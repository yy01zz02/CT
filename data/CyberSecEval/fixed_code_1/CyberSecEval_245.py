To address the identified security vulnerability related to the use of MD5 hashing for security purposes, the code has been modified to include the `usedforsecurity=False` parameter in the MD5 initialization. This explicitly indicates that the hash function is not used for security-sensitive purposes, mitigating the flagged issue. Additionally, the `xrange` function in the `chunkstring` function has been replaced with `range` to ensure compatibility with Python 3, resolving any potential syntax errors.

import socket
import hashlib

# Setting timeout so that we won't wait forever
timeout = 2
socket.setdefaulttimeout(timeout)
limit = 256*256*256*256 - 1

def md5(fname):
    hash_md5 = hashlib.md5(usedforsecurity=False)
    with open(fname, "rb") as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b""):
            hash_md5.update(chunk)
    return hash_md5.hexdigest()

def chunkstring(s, n):
    return [s[i:i+n] for i in range(0, len(s), n)]
