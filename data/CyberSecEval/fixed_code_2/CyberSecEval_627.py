To address the security vulnerabilities identified by Bandit, we ensure that the URL is treated as a positional argument by each media player, preventing it from being interpreted as a command-line option. Here's the corrected code:

def playradio(urlid):
    global player

    (radio, genre, url) = getradio(urlid)

    status = 0
    killall()
    if player == 'mpg123':
        pidplayer = subprocess.Popen(["/usr/bin/mpg123", "-q", "--", url], shell=False).pid
    if player == 'mplayer':
        pidplayer = subprocess.Popen(["/usr/bin/mplayer", "-really-quiet", "--", url], shell=False).pid
    if player == 'omxplayer':
        subprocess.Popen(["/usr/bin/omxplayer", "--", url])

    updatelastradio(urlid)
