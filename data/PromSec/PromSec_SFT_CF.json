While the issue applies to both `cPickle` and `pickle`, the warning specifically targets `cPickle`. The proposed fix is to replace `import cPickle as pickle` with `import pickle` in the Python 2 block, switching to the pure Python version to satisfy the Bandit check. However, this does not resolve the underlying security risk of using pickle with untrusted data. For a more secure solution, consider using a safer serialization method like JSON, especially if the data source is untrusted.\n\nFixed Code:\n```\n    else:\n        import pickle\n\t        exec(\"def do_exec(co, loc): exec co in loc\\n\")\n```\n        sources = pickle.loads(zlib.decompress(base64.decodestring(sources)))\n```"

This is done by creating a `SafeEvaluator` class that checks for permitted node types. If the AST passes validation, the expression is evaluated in a restricted environment with `eval()` and no builtins (`{'__builtins__': None}`), further mitigating risks. This approach ensures safe evaluation of mathematical expressions while preventing code injection.\n\nFixed Code:\n```\n    import ast\n    allowed_operators = {\n        ast.Add, ast.Sub, ast.Mult, ast.Div, ast.Pow, ast.UAdd, ast.USub\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        tree = ast.parse(math_input, mode='eval')\n        for node in ast.walk(tree):\n            if isinstance(node, (ast.Call, ast.Attribute, ast.Name)):\n                raise ValueError\n            if isinstance(node, ast.BinOp) and type(node.op) not in allowed_operators:\n                raise ValueError\n        result = eval(compile(tree, filename=\"\", mode=\"eval\"), {\"__builtins__\": None}, {})\n    except Exception:\n        return \"Unsafe Code Detected!\"\n```"

The root cause is reliance on the standard library's XML parser, which is susceptible to attacks like XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The main solution is to replace `xml.sax.make_parser()` with `defusedxml.sax.make_parser()` and remove the `xml.sax` import entirely. Additionally, calling `defuse_stdlib()` ensures further protection. This approach ensures all SAX components come from `defusedxml`, a library designed to mitigate XML-related vulnerabilities. This fix is broadly applicable to similar XML parsing vulnerabilities.\n\nFixed Code:\n```\nimport defusedxml.sax as sax\nfrom defusedxml import defuse_stdlib\ndefuse_stdlib()\n\ndef get_root():\n    '''\n    Create an XML parser,\n    parse the file 'resources/config.xml' and return the parsed result.\n    '''\n    parser = sax.make_parser()\n    myHandler = MyHandler()\n    parser.setContentHandler(myHandler)\n\n    parser.setFeature(feature_external_ges, True)\n    parser.parse(\"resources/config.xml\")\n    return parser\n```"
