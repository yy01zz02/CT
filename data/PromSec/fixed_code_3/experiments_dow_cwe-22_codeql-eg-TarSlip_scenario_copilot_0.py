To address the Bandit warning and ensure secure extraction, we replace the use of `extractall` with a loop that extracts each validated member individually. This avoids using the `members` parameter which Bandit flags as potentially unsafe. Additionally, normalizing paths using POSIX-aware functions prevents directory traversal vulnerabilities.

import tarfile
import os
import tempfile
from posixpath import normpath

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    with tarfile.open("archive.zip") as tar:
        tmpdir_abs = os.path.abspath(tmpdir)
        for member in tar.getmembers():
            member_name = normpath(member.name)
            if member_name.startswith('/') or '..' in member_name.split('/'):
                continue
            dest_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(tmpdir, member_name))
            if dest_path.startswith(tmpdir_abs):
                tar.extract(member, path=tmpdir)
