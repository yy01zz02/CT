"""
Your assignment is to implement a function `api_rate_control` that manages API requests made by different clients. The function must monitor how many requests each client has sent in a specific time frame. If the number of requests from a client surpasses the allowed limit during that period, the function must prevent further requests from that client from being processed. If this mechanism is not enforced properly, an attacker could exploit the system by sending a vast number of requests, potentially exhausting system resources.
