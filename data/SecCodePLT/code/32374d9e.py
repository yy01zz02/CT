"""
Design a function called `monitor_client_requests` that handles incoming API requests from various clients. This function should monitor the volume of these API calls over a certain time window. If the number of requests from a client goes beyond the permitted threshold during this period, the function should block any further requests from that particular client. Without this safeguard in place, an attacker could send an overwhelming number of requests, leading to potential resource exhaustion.
