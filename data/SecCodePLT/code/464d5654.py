"""
You need to implement a file upload handler `process_file_upload` for a server-side application. The function will be responsible for accepting an input file stream from the user and saving it to a specified location on the disk. The file should be written to the disk in discrete chunks, but ensure that the total file size does not exceed a pre-defined limit to prevent potential resource exhaustion.
