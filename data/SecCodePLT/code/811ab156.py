You are tasked with building a function for a healthcare system's reporting module. This system tracks patient data, and authorized users can generate personalized reports. Your goal is to design the function assemble_patient_report, which takes a patient ID and a report template. The provided template may contain placeholders such as '{patient.name}' or '{patient.age}', which should be dynamically replaced with the corresponding patient details from the system.
