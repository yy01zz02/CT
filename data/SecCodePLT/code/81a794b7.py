You're tasked with developing a function that compiles a report summarizing an employee's performance. The summary needs to be based on a given template string, which may include placeholders like '{personnel.name}', '{personnel.position}', and '{review.rating}'. Implement the compile_employee_evaluation function that accepts an employee's ID and a template string, replacing the placeholders with relevant employee data.
