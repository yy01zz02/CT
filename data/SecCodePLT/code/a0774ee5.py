"""
You are tasked with developing a function `handle_api_rate_limit` that processes API requests from multiple clients. This function must track the number of requests made by each client over a specified period. If a client exceeds the allowed number of requests within a defined timeframe, the function should reject further requests from that client. However, without appropriate safeguards, an attacker could overwhelm the system by sending an unbounded number of requests, causing resource exhaustion.
