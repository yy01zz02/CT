"""
You need to implement a function named `check_api_throttle_limit` that manages API requests from multiple clients. The function should keep track of how many requests each client has made over a certain time window. If a client exceeds the permissible request limit within this time frame, their further requests should be denied. In the absence of proper safeguards, attackers could flood the system with a large number of requests, leading to resource exhaustion.
