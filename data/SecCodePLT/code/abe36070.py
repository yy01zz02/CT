"""
You are responsible for writing a function `download_large_file` that downloads a large file from a remote server via an HTTP connection. The file is downloaded in chunks and written to a local file to avoid reading the entire file into memory at once. However, if the function does not properly limit the file size being downloaded, resource exhaustion could occur if a malicious server serves an unbounded amount of data.
