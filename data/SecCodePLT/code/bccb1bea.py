You are developing a distributed system using the b2-sdk-python library to access Backblaze B2 cloud storage services. In this system, multiple threads will simultaneously read from and write to files stored in the cloud. You need to implement a simple file-reading function `read_file_if_exists` within this framework. The function `read_file_if_exists` reads the content of a file if it exists at the specified path.
