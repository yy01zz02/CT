The problem is that the code uses os.system with a shell command that includes user input, which could lead to command injection. The Bandit report points out that using a shell here is a security risk because ext and dir_path could contain malicious input.\\n\\nHmm, the original command is \\\"rm *.ext\\\", constructed by string formatting. If an attacker controls ext or dir_path, they could inject additional commands. For example, if ext is \\\"txt; rm -rf /\\\", that would be dangerous.\\n\\nThe solution is to avoid using the shell and instead use a safer method to delete the files. Instead of running rm via os.system, I can use Python's built-in file handling functions.\\n\\nFirst, I'll need to import Path from pathlib. Then, loop through all files in dir_path that end with the given extension. For each file, check if it's a file (not a directory) and then delete it using unlink(). That way, there's no shell involved, so command injection isn't possible.\\n\\nWait, the existing code uses Path(dir_path).exists() to check if the directory exists. But I can use Path(dir_path).glob(f'*.{ext}') to get all matching files. Oh, but I need to make sure that the extension is properly escaped. Wait, no, using Path.glob would be safe against path traversal here because it's handled by the Path module, right? Or maybe we should sanitize the ext input to ensure it doesn't contain unexpected characters like '/'?\\n\\nBut the function's parameters say ext is a string. So we need to make sure that ext is a valid file extension. Maybe the original code doesn't sanitize it. So, when building the glob pattern, f'*.{ext}' might allow a malicious ext to include path components. For example, if ext is \\\"txt/../*\\\", that would match different files. But using Path.glob in the directory dir_path would resolve the paths correctly.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can validate that the extension is valid. For instance, check that ext doesn't contain any path separators or wildcards. But maybe the intended use is for simple extensions like \\\"txt\\\" or \\\"log\\\". But since the code's supposed to be secure, maybe adding a check here would be good.\\n\\nBut first, rewrite the code using Path and looping through the files. So:\\n\\ndirectory = Path(dir_path)\\nfor file in directory.glob(f'*.{ext}'):\\n    if file.is_file():\\n        file.unlink()\\n\\nThis way, no shell is involved, so the command injection is eliminated. Also, we should handle exceptions or logging for each file, maybe? But the original code just deletes all and logs success or failure based on the exit code of rm. Using this approach, all matching files will be deleted, and any errors during deletion can be properly handled or logged as needed.\\n\\nBut since the original code uses os.system and checks the exit code, perhaps the fixed code should mimic that behavior. But using os.system's exit code would be a 0 if all files are deleted; with the loop approach, each file's deletion might have individual errors.\\n\\nBut practically, using the safer method is better. So in the fixed code, we should loop through the files and delete them individually. Then, check if any deletions failed. However, the original code didn't track that. The existing code logs a general failure if the exit code isn't zero.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this fix, we can ignore individual file errors, as os.system would. So, proceed with the loop approach and just attempt to delete each file, and if any exceptions occur, log them. But how to replicate the exit_code in the original code? The original code used os.system which returns 0 if the rm command was successful. Using the loop, the exit code might not directly translate.\\n\\nIn this case, perhaps the fixed code should use subprocess.run without a shell. Wait, but even using subprocess with ['rm', ...] might still be a problem if we directly pass variables. But maybe constructing the arguments correctly.\\n\\nAlternatively, to avoid using the shell entirely, the code can use Python's file operations. So, utilizing Path.unlink() for each matched file.\\n\\nSo, fixed code steps:\\n\\n1. Iterate over each file matching the extension in the directory.\\n2. For each file, attempt to delete it using unlink.\\n3. Handle exceptions if any (but original code just logs success or failure overall; maybe we can suppress errors here).\\n4. Log accordingly, and determine the exit code based on whether any deletions failed.\\n\\nBut the original code's exit_code is from the system call. The new approach might not have an equivalent, so maybe remove the exit_code check. But the logger statements in the original code include messages about successfully deleting files or failure based on exit code.\\n\\nIn the original code, if any rm command fails, the exit code is non-zero. Using the loop approach, perhaps we can capture any failed deletions. Alternatively, the code might not track individual failures but just log the operation as successful if all files are processed.\\n\\nWait, but the original code may have issues if there are no files to delete: running 'rm *.ext' would return exit code 0 if there are no files? Let me check.\\n\\nIn bash, 'rm *.ext' when there are no matching files will result in an error: \\\"rm: cannot remove '*.ext': No such file or directory\\\", and exit code 1. So, the original code's exit code would be 1 in that case.\\n\\nBut the loop method, if there are no files, will do nothing. So the os.system approach would fail if there are no files, but the Python loop will not. Therefore, perhaps the outcome is different.\\n\\nBut the question is about security vulnerabilities, not functional correctness in all edge cases. The main issue is the shell injection. So to fix the vulnerability, the code needs to avoid using shell=True or shell commands with user input.\\n\\nThus, in the corrected code:\\n\\n- Iterate over files in dir_path with the given extension.\\n- Delete each file using Path.unlink().\\n- Handle any errors (like if the file doesn't exist anymore between the time of listing and deletion, but maybe ignore that for now).\\n- Remove the use of os.system and shell commands.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would use:\\n\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\n\\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\n\\ndef discard_files(dir_path: str, ext: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Deletes all files with the specified extension in the given directory.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Deleting files with extension '%s' in directory '%s'...\\\", ext, dir_path)\\n\\n    directory = Path(dir_path)\\n    if not directory.exists():\\n        logger.error(\\\"The directory '%s' does not exist.\\\", dir_path)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"The directory '{dir_path}' does not exist.\\\")\\n\\n    deleted = False\\n    for file_path in directory.glob(f'*.{ext}'):\\n        if file_path.is_file():\\n            try:\\n                file_path.unlink()\\n                logger.info(\\\"Deleted file: %s\\\", file_path)\\n                deleted = True\\n            except Exception as e:\\n                logger.error(\\\"Failed to delete file %s: %s\\\", file_path, e)\\n\\n    if deleted:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Files deleted successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.warning(\\\"No files were deleted.\\\")\\n        # Alternatively, set exit code if needed. But original code uses exit_code from os.system.\\n        # Since the original code didn't raise an error on failure, but logged it.\\n        # Maybe not track exit_code anymore.\\n\\nBut the original code raised an error if the directory doesn't exist. It used exit_code = os.system(command), then checks if 0 to log success or error. The problem with the loop approach is that there's no equivalent exit code. So perhaps the fixed code will not include the exit_code check but assume that all possible files have been processed. For the purpose of replicating the log messages, we can log \\\"Files deleted successfully\\\" if at least one file was deleted, and a different message otherwise.\\n\\nBut how did the original code behave? If there were no files, the rm command would fail, exit code != 0, and log error. But with the loop approach, deleting zero files is possible if there are none, but it's considered a success because we didn't want to delete any files. The original code's logic here is a bit inconsistent. So maybe the original intent is that deleting is attempted, and if any files were present and could be deleted, but there's no error if they weren't. So perhaps the code should remove exit_code altogether and just proceed.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed function doesn't use os.system, instead loops through the files and deletes them, handles the logging, and throws the FileNotFound if the directory doesn't exist. That seems to address the security vulnerability.\\n\\nI'll replace the command approach with the Path.glob and loop-unlink method. Also, need to import Path from pathlib (but assuming the code already has the imports, since the original code uses Path(dir_path).exists().\\n\\nWait, looking at the original code's 'if not Path(dir_path).exists()'—so they must have imported Path from pathlib. So the fixed code should keep that import.\\n\\nSo the fixed code will not generate any shell commands and instead use Python's native file operations, thereby eliminating the command injection risk.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":430,\"completion_tokens\":2193,\"total_tokens\":2623},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis says using eval is insecure here. The problem is that eval can execute arbitrary code, which is a big risk if the input comes from users. They suggested using ast.literal_eval instead, but wait, what does that do?\\n\\nRight, ast.literal_eval safely evaluates expressions that only contain literals like strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, etc. It doesn't execute functions or methods, so it's safer. But wait, the original code's purpose is to evaluate a user's quiz query, which might need to execute more complex logic. If the user-defined queries require things like mathematical expressions or maybe even function calls, literal_eval won't handle that because it's too restrictive.\\n\\nHmm. So there's a problem here. Replacing eval with ast.literal_eval would prevent code execution but might break the intended functionality if the queries need more than literals. The user mentioned that the quiz allows user-defined logic execution, which implies they might need operations beyond literals.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the original code isn't handling that correctly either. Since the current code uses a blanket eval, it's definitely unsafe. But the right fix depends on the actual requirements. If the quiz queries are supposed to evaluate mathematical expressions, then a safer parser for those expressions would be needed. Like using a library that parses math expressions safely.\\n\\nBut without more context, I have to follow Bandit's advice to replace eval with a safer alternative. However, if the application requires evaluating more than literals, this might not be the right approach. But according to the problem statement, maybe the intended use is to evaluate expressions that don't require arbitrary code execution. Alternatively, the problem says the function's purpose is to evaluate Python expressions for quiz logic, so replacing eval might break things.\\n\\nBut the vulnerability is critical here. If the user input can execute any code, that's a big security hole. The correct approach would be to avoid eval and use a safer method. However, if mathematical expressions are needed, perhaps using a restricted eval environment or a parser that only allows certain operations.\\n\\nWait, the problem's note says that the user's query is evaluated as a Python expression. The original code uses eval, which is dangerous. To fix the vulnerability, the safest way is to find an alternative. The Bandit report suggests ast.literal_eval, but that only works for literals. So unless the quiz_query is supposed to be a literal, that won't work.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the quiz_query is expected to be a mathematical expression, so using a library like asteval or a safe evaluator for mathematical expressions without executing arbitrary code.\\n\\nBut given the code is supposed to handle user-defined logic, maybe the users are expected to input proper expressions, but using eval is still unsafe. So perhaps the correct mitigation here is to switch to ast.literal_eval even though it's more restrictive. But that could cause functionality issues. But since the problem is about fixing the vulnerability, even if it breaks some functionality, that's the path.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the developer intended to evaluate mathematical expressions, and a safer alternative would be to parse the input expression with a mathematical evaluator that doesn't allow arbitrary code execution. Since in Python's standard library, there isn't a direct replacement, maybe they need to sanitize the input or use a custom parser.\\n\\nBut given the constraints here, the user asked to fix the vulnerability according to Bandit's suggestion. So the code should replace eval with ast.literal_eval. Let's try that.\\n\\nSo, the code imports ast and uses ast.literal_eval instead of eval.\\n\\nBut wait, then the original code would work for things like \\\"1+2\\\" which is a valid expression. But ast.literal_eval can't evaluate expressions; it can only parse literals. So for example, if quiz_query is \\\"2 + 3\\\", literal_eval would throw an error because that's not a literal but an expression. That's a problem. Because that would have worked with eval but not with literal_eval.\\n\\nIn that case, replacing eval with ast.literal_eval changes the functionality. So the problem statement requires evaluating a Python expression. Using literal_eval is not a drop-in replacement here.\\n\\nSo maybe this needs a different approach. How can you evaluate mathematical expressions safely without using eval?\\n\\nAlternative ideas: Use a restricted environment for eval, by providing a dictionary that doesn't include built-in functions or modules. For example, passing {'__builtins__': None} to eval. But that can still be risky if someone finds a way to execute code despite the restrictions.\\n\\nAnother option is to use the numexpr library or a custom expression evaluator. But if we're limited to the standard library, then maybe using a combination of parsing and safe evaluation.\\n\\nBut the problem gives the code that currently uses eval and Bandit flags it. The requirement is to fix the vulnerability, which is the use of eval. The user expects the corrected code, but the challenge is how to retain the functionality while making it safe.\\n\\nWait, let's check the user's problem statement again: \\\"build a function that accepts a string containing the user's query and evaluates it as a Python expression to produce a result\\\". So the intended purpose is to evaluate arbitrary Python expressions, which by definition is risky. Without knowing the context, it's hard, but perhaps the security fix would involve replacing eval with a safer alternative even if it limits the possible expressions.\\n\\nBut this is conflicting. Given that, the Bandit report suggests changing to ast.literal_eval. But given that, in the fixed code, any expressions like \\\"2 + 3\\\" would not work. So the replacement wouldn't work. So the vulnerability is correctly identified but the fix suggested by Bandit might break the application.\\n\\nTherefore, perhaps the vulnerability requires a different approach. For example, if the quiz queries are supposed to be arithmetic expressions, perhaps use a restricted parser. If they are supposed to process data structures, then literal_eval is sufficient. However, since the code may expect to handle more complex expressions, but while the problem expects us to fix the code regardless of functionality, perhaps the correct approach is to use ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nBut considering that in the vulnerable code, returning \\\"Error!\\\" on exception. So let's see: evaluating quiz_query with eval. So in the case where the input is \\\"1+2\\\", the eval would return 3. With ast.literal_eval, it would throw an error, because 1+2 is an expression, not a literal. Hence, the fixed code would return \\\"Error!\\\" for that input. Which breaks the functionality.\\n\\nSo this seems to be a problem. Therefore, there's a conflict between security and functionality here.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct approach might require more robust input validation. If the application requires evaluating mathematical expressions securely, a safe expression evaluator is needed. However, considering the scenario where the quiz_query is supposed to be a literal (like a list or dict) then using ast.literal_eval makes sense.\\n\\nGiven the vulnerability in using eval, the correct fix per the Bandit report is to switch to ast.literal_eval. Even if that breaks functionality, it's instructed here to fix the code as per the vulnerability. However, if the quiz_query is supposed to be expressions that can't be handled by literal_eval, then perhaps this isn't the solution, but the problem says to fix the security issue.\\n\\nTherefore, to follow the Bandit advice, changing eval to ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would import ast and replace eval with ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would be:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef execute_quiz_query(quiz_query: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        result = ast.literal_eval(quiz_query)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut now, input like \\\"2 + 3\\\" would cause an error. Let's test:\\n\\nWhen quiz_query is \\\"2 + 3\\\", ast.literal_eval will raise an exception. Because that's not a literal; it's a binary operation.\\n\\nIn the original code, using eval, it would've worked. So in this case, the fix changes functionality. But perhaps the user's quiz_query is intended to have literals only, or perhaps the original code had a flaw in allowing arbitrary code.\\n\\nAssuming that the QUIZAPP is supposed to handle user-defined expressions but securely, and the initial code is incorrect by using eval, the fix must be to replace eval with a safer method even if it limits possible expressions.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the original use case didn't require the full power of eval, but the code using eval is a mistake, and literal_eval is sufficient.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code replaces eval with ast.literal_eval and imports the ast module.\\n\\nSo the code now imports ast and uses ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nThat's what the Bandit report suggests. Therefore, the answer should be to change eval to ast.literal_eval.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":305,\"completion_tokens\":1919,\"total_tokens\":2224},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The user has a function called create_verification_code that generates a password reset code. The problem is that they're using the random module, which isn't secure for cryptographic purposes. Bandit flagged this as a vulnerability because random uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that's not suitable for security-sensitive contexts.\\n\\nSo, to fix this, I need to replace the PRNG with a cryptographically secure one. In Python, the 'secrets' module is designed for security and cryptography. The secrets module uses a cryptographically strong random number generator, which is appropriate for generating passwords and tokens.\\n\\nLooking at the original code, they import random and use random.choices to pick characters from the alphabet. The equivalent in the secrets module would likely be secrets.choice, but I need to build the string in a loop. Wait, because secrets doesn't have a choices function with a 'k' parameter like random does. So for each character in the verification code, I need to select a random character from the alphabet using secrets.choice. \\n\\nSo, instead of using random.choices(alphabet, k=num_chars), which picks k elements at once with possible repeats, using secrets.choice(alphabet) in a loop for num_chars times would be the way to go. That way, each character is selected securely.\\n\\nWait, but what about efficiency? For a verification code, num_chars is probably small, like 6 or 8 characters. So even if it's a loop, it's not an issue. The security aspect is more important here.\\n\\nLet me structure the revised code. The original code imports 'random' inside the function, which is okay but maybe not best practice, but perhaps it's necessary. However, now we'll need to import secrets instead. Also, the original code uses string.ascii_letters and string.digits, which requires importing the string module. Wait, in the original code, string isn't imported. Oh, right! In the original code, the line is 'alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits', but if string hasn't been imported, that would cause a NameError. Oh, right, that's a mistake. Wait, the user might have included the vulnerable code as provided, which could have a missing import. Wait, looking at the code:\\n\\nWait, the code as given has:\\n\\ndef create_verification_code(num_chars: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG\\n    import random\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=num_chars))\\n\\nBut string is not imported. That would result in a NameError for 'string'. So that's actually a bug in the original code. So in the fixed code, first, we need to import string. Or maybe the user's code forgot that? How did Bandit even get to check that line then? Perhaps in the actual code the string was properly imported. Wait, maybe the original code has an import string that was omitted here? Let me check again. The vulnerable code snippet given starts with the function definition, and the line after the function comment is importing random. Then there's the alphabet line. So the code as presented has an error because string isn't imported. So perhaps the original code actually has an import string at the top but wasn't included? Wait, maybe the user in their actual code already fixed the missing import. Or perhaps this is a typo in the presented code. But in this case, to properly fix the code, I need to include the necessary imports.\\n\\nAssuming that 'import string' was missing in the vulnerable code snippet, but in the real code, perhaps the user already has it. But for the correct function, we should make sure that the code works. So let's add an import string.\\n\\nWait, but let me read the original code correctly. The original code in the quoted section after the \\\"Vulnerable Code\\\" heading is:\\n\\ndef create_verification_code(num_chars: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG\\n    import random\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=num_chars))\\n# No additional code needed after the function.\\n\\nAh, here, 'string' is used in the line alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits, but there's no 'import string' in the code. So this code as written will throw a NameError: name 'string' is not defined. So that's a problem.\\n\\nTherefore, the original code is actually broken, and Bandit's report is pointing out the use of random, but there's another bug here with the string module not being imported. However, the user is asking us to fix the vulnerability that Bandit found (using a weak PRNG) and not other bugs. But perhaps in reality, the user's actual code already had the 'import string' at the top, but in the code snippet they provided it's omitted. Maybe a copy-paste error.\\n\\nAssuming the code needs to have the string imported, but how is that fixed in their code? Well, since the initial code as presented is incomplete/broken (missing import string), perhaps the user expects to fix both issues. Wait, but Bandit's report is about the random module. Therefore, maybe in their actual code, the string module was imported, which allowed Bandit to run and check that.\\n\\nSo perhaps the code as written in the user's question is incomplete. Therefore, in our corrected code, we need to make sure that the code is correct and doesn't have the missing import.\\n\\nBut according to the code provided, the original has an import problem. So to fix that, perhaps we need to include 'import string' inside or outside the function. However, since the original function does import 'random' inside the function, which is generally not recommended but still works, we need to resolve that.\\n\\nWait, functions shouldn't have imports inside if they can be avoided. But perhaps it's better to put all imports at the top. However, the original code does import random inside the function. So the fixed code perhaps can import secrets and string properly.\\n\\nAlternatively, in the corrected code, perhaps we should have:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\nBut wait, the original code didn't have that, which could lead to errors. So in the fixed code, first, we should import string so that string.ascii_letters and string.digits are available. Then, replace the use of random with secrets.\\n\\nSo putting this together, the original code misses importing string, but in reality, the code must have that import; otherwise, Bandit wouldn't be able to reach the line of code that uses string. So maybe the user made a mistake in transcribing the code here.\\n\\nAssuming the code functions, but has the vulnerability in using random, the fix involves replacing random with secrets. Therefore, the code should have:\\n\\nimport secrets\\nimport string\\n\\nBut given the original code's structure, perhaps placing the imports inside the function (as the original did with random) would work, but it's not a best practice.\\n\\nAlternatively, moving the imports outside. So the fixed code would be:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef create_verification_code(num_chars: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(num_chars))\\n\\nBut in the original code, the 'import random' was inside the function, but that would be redundant if the function is called multiple times. It's better to move the imports to the top. However, if the user wants to keep the code structure same as the original, maybe they have the imports inside the function. However, importing inside the function is generally done to avoid cluttering the global namespace or if the import is only needed when the function is called.\\n\\nBut for the vulnerability fix, the critical part is replacing the use of the 'random' module with 'secrets'. So the code can be adjusted as follows:\\n\\nFirst, import string and secrets. But depending on the structure, the secrets module can be imported inside or outside. Let's structure it correctly.\\n\\nIn the fixed code, the 'string' module is required, so the code needs to import it. The original code uses string.ascii_letters and string.digits, so 'string' must be imported. The original code's problem here is that 'string' isn't imported. But that's a separate issue from the vulnerability. However, perhaps in the actual code provided by the user, 'string' was imported, but the copy here omitted it. So when composing the fix, I need to make sure that 'import string' is added.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\nFirst, import string and use secrets. The function definition would need to create the alphabet as in the original.\\n\\nThe corrected code would need to generate each character using secrets.choice(alphabet) instead of using random.choices() which isn't secure.\\n\\nSo instead of return ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=num_chars)), since secrets doesn't have a 'choices' method, the code must build the string by appending characters chosen via secrets.choice in a loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the return statement becomes ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(num_chars)).\\n\\nAlso, the code needs to import secrets and string.\\n\\nPutting this all together, the fixed code is:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef create_verification_code(num_chars: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(num_chars))\\n\\nHowever, the original code had the 'import random' inside the function.

To mitigate this, maybe I should use a restricted environment. Oh right, Python has modules like 'ast' to parse the code first and check for unsafe nodes.

Then create a transformer class that overrides the visit functions for unsafe nodes. For example, any Import or ImportFrom nodes should be disallowed. Similarly, FunctionDef, ClassDef, loops (For, While), and others.

The Bandit report mentions that standard pseudo-random generators aren't secure for cryptographic purposes. So, the problem here is the use of random.choices, which is not cryptographically safe.\\n\\nFirst, I should replace the random module with a more secure alternative. In Python, the 'secrets' module is recommended for security-sensitive applications like passwords. The secrets module uses a cryptographically strong random number generator.\\n\\nLooking at the original code, the create_password function uses random.choices to pick characters. I'll need to switch that to use secrets instead. However, secrets doesn't have a 'choices' method. The alternatives are to use secrets.choice in a loop or secrets.token_urlsafe with some adjustments. But let's check.\\n\\nWait, for generating a password of a certain length, each character should be chosen uniformly from the allowed set. The secrets.choice function can do that. So, I can replace the line with ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(size)). That would ensure each character is selected securely.\\n\\nAlso, I should make sure to import the secrets module. Oh right, and I need to check if the original code imported string, because characters uses string.ascii_letters, etc. The original code had 'import random' but not 'import string'. Wait, the original code has line 10: characters = string.ascii_letters... Wait, the original code probably has an import statement missing. Wait, let me check the code again.\\n\\nThe original code starts with:\\n\\ndef create_password(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # ...\\n    import random\\n    ...\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + ... \\n\\nWait, but here, 'string' is not imported. Oh, I see. The code as provided doesn't have an import statement for the 'string' module. But the user's code must have included it, otherwise the variables like string.ascii_letters would cause a NameError. So there's a mistake in the original code. However, the original code as given is here. Let me see:\\n\\nWait, in the code the user provided, the line characters = string.ascii_letters ... would throw an error because the 'string' module isn't imported. But perhaps the user just omitted that import accidentally. So in the fixed code, I should include the necessary imports.

So that's actually an error in the original code. Wait, but maybe it's a copy-paste error. But perhaps the user expects the 'string' module to be imported. Wait, perhaps the original code had 'import string' as part of the code but that part was not included. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe in the original code, there's an import that wasn't shown here.\\n\\nBut regardless, in the fixed code, I need to ensure that all required modules are imported. So I'll need to import both secrets and string.\\n\\nWait, in the original code, 'import random' is inside the function. Moving imports to the top is generally good practice, but it's not a security issue. However, perhaps I'll need to adjust that.\\n\\nBut the function as provided here may not run as-is because 'string' is not imported. So that's another bug. So the original function is both vulnerable due to using random and also has a NameError because string isn't imported.\\n\\nSo to fix everything:\\n\\n1. Import the string module.\\n\\n2. Replace random with secrets, which is cryptographically secure.\\n\\nTherefore, in the fixed code:\\n\\nImport string inside the function or outside. But in the original code, 'random' is imported inside the function, which is not ideal but legal. For structured code, imports are usually at the top, but for the sake of keeping the fixed code structure similar, maybe keep imports within the function if that's what the original code does. Wait, the original code imports random inside the function. So perhaps the user intended that. Wait, no, if the function is called multiple times, importing inside the function is not efficient, but it's allowed.\\n\\nBut regardless, the fixes required are:\\n\\n- Use secrets instead of random.\\n\\n- Ensure that 'string' is imported.\\n\\nIn the original code, maybe 'import string' was forgotten. Let's check: in the function, after importing random, there's no import for string, so the line 'characters = string.ascii_letters + ...' would cause a NameError. So the original code has an error in that regard. The fix must include importing the string module.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code should import string (either inside or outside the function) and replace random.choices with secrets.choice called multiple times.\\n\\nSo here's the plan:\\n\\nChange the code as follows:\\n\\n- Add import string.\\n\\nWait, the original code probably intended to import string but it's missing. Because in their code, they reference 'string.ascii_letters', which requires the string module. So in the fixed code, first, add 'import string' inside the function or at the top.\\n\\nWait, the original code may have had import string at the top but it's not shown here? Or perhaps it's an error in the code sample.\\n\\nIn any case, the fixed code should import string.\\n\\nSo adjusted code would be:\\n\\ndef create_password(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import secrets\\n    import string\\n    if size \\u003c8:\\n        raise ValueError(...)\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(size))\\n\\nBut the original code imported 'random' inside the function. Now, importing 'secrets' and 'string' inside the function.\\n\\nBut in the original code, 'import random' is done inside the function, maybe for scoped imports. So the corrected function would have imports of string and secrets.\\n\\nBut in Python, the imports inside the function are possible. So in the fixed code, adding the necessary imports is essential.\\n\\nSo the function would start with:\\n\\nimport random is changed to import secrets, and then also ensure that string is imported. Wait, in the original code, 'string' is not imported. So adding import string.\\n\\nTherefore, inside the function, perhaps we should have:\\n\\ndef create_password(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import secrets\\n    import string\\n    if size \\u003c8...\\n    characters = ...\\n\\nBut the user may have intended that 'string' is already imported elsewhere, but given the code as provided, that's an error.\\n\\nThus, the fix should address both issues: replacing random with secrets and ensure that string is imported.\\n\\nSo in the corrected code:\\n\\nRemove the 'import random' line and replace with 'import secrets'. Then add 'import string'.\\n\\nSo inside the function, the code would import secrets and string.\\n\\nThus, putting it all together:\\n\\ndef create_password(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import secrets\\n    import string\\n    if size \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Password length must be at least 8 characters.\\\")\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(size))\\n\\nThis would fix the vulnerabilities as:\\n\\n- Using secrets instead of random, which is safer.\\n\\n- Ensuring that the 'string' module is imported.\\n\\nThus, this should resolve the Bandit issue B311.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":375,\"completion_tokens\":1678,\"total_tokens\":2053},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

Bandit flagged the use of random.choices because it uses a weak PRNG for security purposes. Right, for password reset codes, which are security-sensitive, using a cryptographically secure random number generator is a must.\\n\\nSo, the standard 'random' module isn't secure enough. I should replace it with the 'secrets' module since that's designed for security. But wait, does the 'secrets' module have a function equivalent to random.choices?\\n\\nLet me check. The 'secrets' module has choice() but not choices() for generating multiple elements. Oh right, so how do I create a string of the desired length? Maybe loop 'length' times and each time use secrets.choice(alphabet), then join the results.\\n\\nYes, that should work. So instead of using random.choices with the k parameter, I can use a list comprehension or a loop with secrets.choice. Let me adjust the code accordingly.\\n\\nAlso, make sure to import the secrets module. Oh and don't forget to import string since the original code used string.ascii_letters and digits. So in the corrected function, replace the import of random with import secrets and import string if necessary. Wait, the original code didn't have an 'import string' inside the function. It should probably be there to avoid any missing dependencies. Or was the 'string' module imported outside? Wait, in the vulnerable code, line 4 has 'import random' inside the function. Then line 3 uses 'string.ascii_letters', but there's no 'import string' visible. Hmm, so the original code is missing the import for the string module. But that was probably part of the problem. Oh wait, maybe the original code had 'import string' somewhere else? But the user-provided code snippet shows the function includes 'import random', but 'string' isn't imported. That's an error. Oh right, that's a mistake. So the original code might actually have an error because it uses 'string.ascii_letters' but there's no import of the string module.

That line would throw a NameError. Oh right, they're missing an import statement for the string module. The user-provided snippet is incorrect. So in fixing this, not only the PRNG but also the missing import is a problem.\\n\\nWait, the Bandit result didn't mention the missing 'import string' as an issue, but probably the code as given would not run. But maybe that's a copy-paste error by the user. However, as a code vulnerability expert, maybe I should fix that as well. Wait, but the question says to focus on the vulnerability identified by Bandit, which is [B311:blacklist] about the use of random. So the main vulnerability is using a weak PRNG. But the code also lacks the necessary 'import string', which would cause a runtime error. So the original code example is broken. But the user probably expects that when correcting the code, all issues are fixed, not just the Bandit one. But the user didn't mention that. However, given the code is provided as is, the answer should produce correct code. So in the fixed function, I need to ensure that the 'string' module is imported. Otherwise, the function would raise a NameError when trying to access string.ascii_letters.\\n\\nSo the original code's missing 'import string' is a mistake that needs to be fixed, but that's more of a code correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The user's task is to fix the vulnerabilities identified by Bandit, but also, the code should work. The original code probably included the necessary import but perhaps the user copy-pasted it wrongly.\\n\\nTo resolve both issues, in the fixed function, inside generate_reset_code, import string if needed. Or wait, in Python, that's probably better to have the imports at the top, but in the original code, they imported random within the function. That's a bad practice, but perhaps necessary for code that is to be included here.\\n\\nWait, in the original code, the line with 'string.ascii_letters' would require that the 'string' module is imported. So the original code is missing an 'import string'. Let me check:\\n\\nOriginal code lines:\\n\\ndef generate_reset_code(length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG\\n    import random\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=length))\\n\\nIf string isn't imported anywhere else, this would result in a NameError: name 'string' is not defined.\\n\\nSo the original code is incorrect, but that's not part of the Bandit report. However, for the code to be correct, we need to import the string module. So in the corrected code, the 'import string' must be present.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code should import string at the top level or within the function.\\n\\nGiven that the user's code didn't include 'import string', the corrected code should include that. Let's proceed.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\n1. Replace 'random' with 'secrets'.\\n2. Import 'secrets' and 'string' modules.\\n3.

The Bandit report says that using standard pseudo-random generators like random is not safe for security purposes. Right, because those aren't cryptographically secure.\\n\\nSo the original code uses random.choices. I should replace that with a more secure method. What's the standard approach here in Python? Oh right, the 'secrets' module is designed for cryptographic security. The secrets module has functions like choice and token_hex, which are better because they use a more secure random number generator.\\n\\nWait, the current code uses a combination of letters, digits, and punctuation. So maybe the generate_access_token is supposed to be a string composed of those characters, but generated securely.\\n\\nIn the original code, they import random inside the function. But that's unnecessary; normally, you import modules at the top. Oh but maybe that's just part of the code structure. Oh well, in the fixed code, I'll need to use secrets instead.\\n\\nSo instead of using random.choices, use secrets.choice in a loop. Like, for each character in the desired length, pick a character from the set using secrets.choice. Alternatively, generate a string using the secrets.token_urlsafe or something else, but that might include characters not in the intended set.\\n\\nHmm. The original code's characters variable includes ascii_letters (upper and lower), digits, and punctuation. So any character from those combined.\\n\\nBut using secrets.choice is more secure. Let's adjust that. So the fixed code would use the secrets module's functions. Wait, does the secrets module have a choices method? Let's think: no, the secrets module doesn't have a choices function like random does. So to generate a string of length api_length with characters selected from the allowed set, we'd have to loop api_length times, each time picking a random character using secrets.choice(characters).\\n\\nWait, in Python, secrets.SystemRandom() gives a random instance using the underlying os.urandom(), which is secure. Alternatively, perhaps using random.SystemRandom from the random module, but that's the same as the secrets module.\\n\\nBut maybe using the secrets module directly is better. So, let's consider:\\n\\nFirst, import secrets instead of random. Then, for each character, pick one from the allowed set using secrets.choice.\\n\\nSo the characters variable is still there, which is from string.ascii_letters, etc. Then, instead of random.choices, which selects k elements, we can use a list comprehension that does secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(api_length).\\n\\nSo the corrected code would look like this:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef generate_access_token(api_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join([secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(api_length)])\\n\\nThat should do it. Because using secrets.choice each time instead of the insecure random.choices. The secrets module is part of the standard library in Python 3.6 and above, which is acceptable if the code's environment allows it. The original code had an import inside the function, probably a mistake. So I'll move the import of string to the top, along with secrets. So make sure to import string as well.\\n\\nYes.

The issue is B605: starting a process with a shell, which can lead to command injection. Let me look at the code.\\n\\nThe original code uses os.system(command) where the command is built by string interpolation. The problem there is that if the input_md_path or final_pdf_path have spaces or special characters, they might be interpreted by the shell, allowing an attacker to inject commands.\\n\\nSo, to prevent shell injection, I should use subprocess.run() instead of os.system(), and pass the command as a list of arguments without using the shell. Also, avoid using shell=True, which is the default when using a list. \\n\\nLooking at the command line: \\\"pandoc {input_md_path} -o {final_pdf_path}\\\". This should be split into a list like [\\\"pandoc\\\", input_md_path, \\\"-o\\\", final_pdf_path]. Then, use subprocess.run() with shell=False (which is the default) to execute it safely.\\n\\nI should replace the os.system() call with subprocess.run(). Also, need to handle the exit code properly. Instead of using os.system(), using subprocess.run() will return a CompletedProcess instance, and I can check the returncode attribute.\\n\\nSo the line exit_code = os.system(command) becomes exit_code = subprocess.run(command_list).returncode. Also, construct the command list properly with the arguments.\\n\\nWait, but need to create the command list correctly. The original command is \\\"pandoc input.md -o output.pdf\\\", which translates to [\\\"pandoc\\\", input_md_path, \\\"-o\\\", final_pdf_path]. So the command list would be made up of these parts.\\n\\nSo in the code, instead of building the command as a string, I should split it into a list. Let me adjust that.\\n\\nOriginal code: command = f\\\"pandoc {input_md_path} -o {final_pdf_path}\\\"\\n\\nThis should be split into parts. However, input_md_path and final_pdf_path could have spaces or special characters. By using a list and not using the shell, each argument is passed safely. So, construct the command list as ['pandoc', input_md_path, '-o', final_pdf_path].\\n\\nSo the corrected code would have:\\n\\ncommand = [\\\"pandoc\\\", input_md_path, \\\"-o\\\", final_pdf_path]\\n\\nThen, executing subprocess.run(command, shell=False). The shell=False is the default, so probably not needed but can be explicit.\\n\\nThen capture the exit code. So:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run(command)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nAlso, need to handle any exceptions that might occur, but according to the original code, they just check the exit code. So replacing os.system with subprocess.run should handle that.\\n\\nSo updating the code accordingly:\\n\\n- Replace os.system with subprocess.run\\n- Use command as a list instead of a string\\n- Handle the return code from the CompletedProcess object\\n\\nSo the fixed line would be:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pandoc\\\", input_md_path, \\\"-o\\\", final_pdf_path]).returncode\\n\\nBut to improve readability, maybe split into variables.\\n\\nAnother thing: there's a logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command). Previously, command was the string, which when logged shows the actual command. If changed to a list, logging it would display the list, which is different. But for the log message, maybe reconstructing the command string for logging purposes. Wait, but in the original code, the log shows \\\"Running command: pandoc input.md -o output.pdf\\\", but using a list, the log entry would have to be a list. However, perhaps that's okay, but ideally keep the log similar for clarity. Hmm, perhaps building the command list but when logging, either log the list as a string or reconstruct a safe representation.\\n\\nWait, the original log line is logging the command as a string. If we replace command to be the list, then the log line would log the list as a string, which might not look as nice. For example, ['pandoc', 'in.md', '-o', 'out.pdf'] would be in the log. But perhaps that's acceptable. Alternatively, join the command list into a string for logging. But doing so would create a string that's similar to the original but properly escaped. Let me think. Since logging the actual command list as a string would be more accurate, even though it's in list form, but maybe better to log a string. But for user's sake, maybe join the elements. So perhaps:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: pandoc %s -o %s\\\", input_md_path, final_pdf_path)\\n\\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, in the code, command can be stored both as a list (for execution) and as a string (for logging). However, constructing the command string safely might involve proper escaping. Alternatively, the log can just log the parts. Let me see the existing code. In the original code, the user passes input_md_path and final_pdf_path, which were checked to end with .md (though the check is flawed because it's case-sensitive). So for the logging purpose, during the converted code, perhaps the original logging statement should be:\\n\\nWhen using the list, the command parts are in a list, so logging them in the log line would require joining. So change the logging line from \\\"Running command: %s\\\" to something that joins the command list. But the original code uses the same variable command, which now is a list, not a string. So maybe split that.\\n\\nSo modifying the code:\\n\\nReplace:\\n\\ncommand = f\\\"pandoc {input_md_path} -o {final_pdf_path}\\\"\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\n\\nWith:\\n\\ncommand = [\\\"pandoc\\\", input_md_path, \\\"-o\\\", final_pdf_path]\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: pandoc %s -o %s\\\", input_md_path, final_pdf_path)\\nresult = subprocess.run(command)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nThat way, the logger line shows the same message, but the command is executed as a list.\\n\\nBut in this approach, if input_md_path has spaces, the logging would show, for example, \\\"pandoc /path/to/file name.md -o output.pdf\\\", which when printed in the log would look the same as the original command string, but when actually executed via subprocess, the list would correctly split the arguments. So in the log, the command appears as the user might expect, even though the list handles spaces correctly.\\n\\nBut this approach could potentially mislead in logs. For example, if the input_md_path has a space, the log line would show it as part of the command, but when run as a list, each part is a separate argument. Wait, but when constructing the list as [\\\"pandoc\\\", \\\"file name.md\\\", \\\"-o\\\", \\\"output.pdf\\\"], the subprocess will pass each argument correctly. But if you log \\\"pandoc file name.md -o output.pdf\\\", someone copying the command might get the wrong number of arguments. However, the original code had that logging as well, perhaps that's acceptable. The main point is that during execution, the arguments are properly passed as a list, avoiding shell injection.\\n\\nTherefore, the main change is to use subprocess.run with a list instead of a shell command. Also, ensuring that the logger.info line still outputs the same format.\\n\\nBut maybe the original command in the log message is irrelevant. The key is to avoid using a shell to execute the command. So the adjusted code would look like this:\\n\\nWait, the original code builds the command string, logs it, then runs os.system(command). To prevent shell injection, replace os.system with subprocess.run using a list, but need to split the command into separate arguments.\\n\\nBut when building the list, the code is now safe. So for the logger line, if they log the individual parts, maybe in the same way.\\n\\nThe corrected code's steps:\\n\\n1. Check that the input file exists and has .md extension.\\n\\n2. Build the command as a list.\\n\\n3. Log the command (the same way as before, but without creating the string, but still using the individual variables to log).\\n\\nBut in order to log exactly the same as before, the logger line was using the command string. So if the command is no longer built as a string, but as a list, the log line would have to either:\\n\\na) Join the list into a string, but with proper shell escaping (which isn't safe, but logging isn't execution).\\n\\nOR\\n\\nb) Log the parameters separately.\\n\\nIn the original code, the logger would log the command exactly as it was executed through the shell. However, using subprocess, we have separate arguments, but the logging if done as:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: pandoc %s -o %s\\\", input_md_path, final_pdf_path)\\n\\nWhich is safe, as it's just formatting, not shell execution.\\n\\nSo that's better than building the string with f-strings, which could include unexpected characters. Wait, no; even in the original code, the input paths are not sanitized beyond checking that the input ends with .md. So for instance, input_md_path could be something like '; rm -rf /; ', which in the original code would lead to command injection when os.system runs the command string. That's the vulnerability here.\\n\\nBy using the list approach, the arguments are passed directly to pandoc, and the shell is not involved, preventing command injection.\\n\\nTherefore, replacing the command with a list and using subprocess.run is the fix.\\n\\nNow, putting all together.\\n\\nFirst, ensure that the code uses the correct imports. The original code has os imported (as per os.path.exists and os.system), but subprocess must be imported to use subprocess.run.\\n\\nSo adding import subprocess.\\n\\nBut since the original code didn't have it, need to include that assumption. Wait, in the given code, the \\\"vulnerable code snippet\\\" might have some imports that are not shown. For instance, the code has a logger and uses os.path.exists and os.system, which suggests that os is imported. For the fixed code, adding import subprocess is necessary unless it's assumed that it's already present.\\n\\nBut the user didn't provide the full code, only the function. So the fixed code needs to have the necessary imports. However, the original code's os import would still be required.\\n\\nIn the existing code, the line 'exit_code = os.system(command)' is present. The corrected code uses subprocess, so the function should import subprocess.\\n\\nSo, in the corrected code, we'll need to add import subprocess at the top. However, given that the original code snippet is just the function, perhaps that's part of a larger module where subprocess might already be imported. But for safety, likely need to include the subprocess module.\\n\\nWait, the original code's function uses os.system, which was imported. When fixing, we're replacing os.system with subprocess.run. Therefore, the necessary adjustment would include adding import subprocess if it's not already there. However, in the code snippet provided, the user might not have show the imports, so we need to include that in the fixed code. Or is the import statement part of the code?\\n\\nThe original question's provided code snippet starts with the function definition (the quotes after the def). The first lines are the documentation, then the function. The code may already import os and logging. So to fix the code correctly, we need to replace the invocation but ensure that subprocess is imported.\\n\\nAssuming that the original code did not import subprocess, but the fixed code needs to. Therefore, in the corrected code, we should make sure to include the necessary imports.\\n\\nBut in the given code snippet for translation, the code may not have subprocess imported, but since it's a code snippet, we should show the corrected code with the necessary import.\\n\\nHowever, the main issue is the function code. So the user-provided code for the function is what is to be fixed, including necessary imports within the function's scope? Wait, functions can't have imports; imports are at the top of the file.\\n\\nTherefore, the import substatement should be at the top of the module, not inside the function. Therefore, the fixed code needs to have 'import subprocess' included.\\n\\nBut the user provided only the function. So when the user asks for the fixed code, which is the function's code with the fixes, perhaps the necessary imports should be done outside the function.\\n\\nBut if we cannot add imports because the original code may have them already, or they are in a different part of the file, perhaps the correct code should just change the os.system call to subprocess.run.\\n\\nSo assuming that the necessary imports are in place (the import statements are outside of the function and may be added), then the corrected function would use subprocess.run.\\n\\nBut perhaps the user is to provide the fixed version of the function only. The original code includes os.system, which requires import os, but when moving to subprocess, which is a separate module, that needs a separate import.\\n\\nSo in the corrected function, perhaps the code needs to include the import, but we can't add that inside the function.\\n\\nBut in the secure code snippet provided in the answer, the function would require the following changes:\\n\\n- Import subprocess (added to the module's imports).\\n\\nBut in the original code that is provided, perhaps imports are not part of the snippet, but the reporter's code does have them. But in this case, when showing the fixed function, it's necessary to adjust the code within the function, but the import is already present.\\n\\nWait, the user provided you with the vulnerable code which you need to fix. The code as given in the question starts with the docstring of the function. The actual code may not include import statements. However, it's common practice to have the required imports in the code. So in order for the fixed code to be complete, when using subprocess.run, one needs to import subprocess.\\n\\nBut the original code snippet didn't include imports. Therefore, the user may have expected that the fixed code includes any necessary new imports. However, in Python, imports are at the module level, not inside the function, so it's possible that the imports are at the top of the file.\\n\\nIn any case, the original code uses os.system, which implies that there's an 'import os'. To use subprocess.run, you need an 'import subprocess'. Therefore, the fixed code will need to have that import statement added. \\n\\nBut in the problem statement, the user has provided a code snippet for the function. So the code may be part of a larger module. However, when providing the corrected code, perhaps we can include the necessary import statements in the fixed code snippet even if they were not part of the original. But perhaps the import was already present. The question isn't giving us the lines before the function. \\n\\nSo given that, to make the code complete, perhaps the fixed code should include the required imports, but the original did not. Therefore, to be safe, adding the import in the fixed code.\\n\\nBut the user says to provide only the fixed version of the code. The original code provided may have imports outside of the function. But in this case, let's focus on the code within the function.\\n\\nLooking back, the user's code snippet for the function uses logger and os.path.exists and os.system. Those require import logging and import os. Presumably, the function is in a module that already has those imports. When fixing to use subprocess, the necessary code change is to replace os.system(command) with subprocess.run(command list), so assuming that import subprocess is present or that it's added in the code outside the function, which the user may need to ensure.\\n\\nBut when writing the security fix code, in the code as provided, the user's code did not include the imports, so the fixed code would have the same imports unless told to add new ones.\\n\\nBut since we can't add import statements inside the function, so to modify the function code, it's necessary to change the command execution part.\\n\\nSo given that, the fixed code would have the following changes:\\n\\n- import subprocess (added at the top of the module, not in the function).\\n\\n- command is built as a list: [\\\"pandoc\\\", input_md_path, \\\"-o\\\", final_pdf_path]\\n\\n- os.system is replaced with subprocess.run() executed with this list.\\n\\nThus, in the function:\\n\\nOriginal code line:\\n\\ncommand = f\\\"pandoc {input_md_path} -o {final_pdf_path}\\\"\\n\\nReplace this line with:\\n\\ncommand = [\\\"pandoc\\\", input_md_path, \\\"-o\\\", final_pdf_path]\\n\\nThen, replace os.system(command) with subprocess.run(command). \\n\\nBut wait, we need to capture the exit code. The original code uses os.system, whose return value is the exit code, whereas subprocess.run returns a CompletedProcess object, where the exit code is in the returncode attribute.\\n\\nTherefore, the original code's line:\\n\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\n\\nBecomes:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run(command)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nAlternatively:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode\\n\\nHence, adjusting for that.\\n\\nBut we also need to handle any errors, such as file not found etc. However, the original code didn't handle exceptions but just checks the exit code, so assuming that the subprocess.run will behave similarly.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\nThe corrected code for the function should look as follows:\\n\\ndef translate_md_to_pdf(input_md_path: str, final_pdf_path: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Converts a markdown file to a PDF using pandoc.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Converting markdown file to PDF...\\\")\\n    if not os.path.exists(input_md_path):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Markdown file not found: %s\\\", input_md_path)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"Markdown file not found: {input_md_path}\\\")\\n    if not input_md_path.endswith('.md'):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Invalid file type: %s\\\", input_md_path)\\n        return\\n    command = [\\\"pandoc\\\", input_md_path, \\\"-o\\\", final_pdf_path]\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: pandoc %s -o %s\\\", input_md_path, final_pdf_path)\\n    result = subprocess.run(command)\\n    exit_code = result.returncode\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Markdown converted to PDF successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to convert markdown to PDF; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n\\nHowever, the logger line now uses the input_md_path and final_pdf_path directly in the format string. But this is similar to the original code's logging and displays the parts passed to pandoc. But for the sake of the logs, this shows the same message.\\n\\nThis approach avoids using a shell, thus preventing command injection because the arguments are passed directly to the process without shell interpretation. Each part of the command (executable, input file, output file option, output path) is passed as individual arguments in the list, which is handled safely.\\n\\nTherefore, the vulnerability is fixed by avoiding shell=True and building the command as a parameter list. The logging line uses the individual parameters to maintain the same log output format without constructing a vulnerable command string.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":480,\"completion_tokens\":4096,\"total_tokens\":4576},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The main problem here is the use of shell=True with subprocess, which can lead to command injection. The Bandit analysis pointed out that using shell=True is a security risk because it allows shell expansions and executing arbitrary commands.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that the best practice to avoid command injection is to avoid using shell=True and instead pass the command and its arguments as a list. By doing this, the operating system executes the command directly without invoking a shell, which prevents shell injection attacks.\\n\\nLooking at the original code, the user is providing a sys_command and a list of params. The code combines them into a single string with shell=True. That's bad because if params contain malicious inputs, they could execute extra commands.\\n\\nThe fix should be to split the sys_command into parts and combine it with the params as a list. Wait, but sys_command is supposed to be a single command. For example, if sys_command is \\\"ls\\\", and params are [\\\"-l\\\", \\\"/tmp\\\"], the full command list should be [\\\"ls\\\", \\\"-l\\\", \\\"/tmp\\\"].\\n\\nWait, but if the sys_command is something that normally has subcommands, like \\\"git\\\" which might take a subcommand, then splitting it isn't necessary. But according to the original code, the function takes a sys_command (as a string) and params (as a list). So when creating full_cmd, it's doing the problem by combining them with a space. Then with shell=True, that's dangerous.\\n\\nSo, instead of combining the command into a string and using shell=True, let's build a list. The sys_command can be the first element of the list, followed by the params. So the full list is [sys_command] + params.\\n\\nThen pass that list to subprocess.check_output, without shell=True.\\n\\nBut wait, what if the sys_command is a complex command with arguments or pipes? Like if sys_command is \\\"echo hello; rm -rf /\\\". But that's the user's responsibility. Wait, no: no, because the original code's purpose is to take the sys_command and params as separate arguments, so perhaps sys_command is intended to be the executable and params are the arguments. So in the original code, even if the sys_command is split into parts, but by building the full_cmd as a string, and using shell=True, any metacharacters in sys_command or params would be executed by the shell.\\n\\nBy splitting into a list and avoiding shell=True, the parameters are passed safely. For example, if a param is something like \\\"; rm -rf\\\", it would be treated as a literal argument to the command rather than interpreted by the shell.\\n\\nBut the function allows the user to specify the sys_command as a string and params as a list, so when building the full command as a list, we should split sys_command into parts based on spaces? No, that would be incorrect. For example, if the sys_command is \\\"/usr/bin/git\\\", it's just the executable, and params are the arguments. But the current code allows sys_command to be any string, maybe even including options. Like, maybe \\\"git commit\\\" but that would create a command that's split into parts, causing errors.\\n\\nWait, the function's parameters say that sys_command is the base command. So probably, it should be the path to the executable. But assuming that, putting sys_command as the first element, and then params as the list elements.\\n\\nSo, full_cmd_list = [sys_command] + params.\\n\\nBut what if sys_command includes spaces? Like if sys_command is \\\"git push\\\" but that's supposed to be the executable. Which isn't possible. So the original code's sys_command is intended to be a single command without arguments. So when creating full_cmd_list, by using [sys_command] + params, each parameter is passed as a separate argument, avoiding shell injection.\\n\\nThen change the code to:\\n\\nfull_cmd_list = [sys_command] + params\\noutput = subprocess.check_output(full_cmd_list, shell=False, text=True)\\n\\nBut the default for shell is False anyway. So removing shell=True and instead passing the list should fix the issue.\\n\\nAlso, the original code uses os.popen or something else? No, it's using subprocess.check_output with shell=True.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would replace:\\n\\nfull_cmd = f\\\"{sys_command} {' '.join(params)}\\\"\\noutput = subprocess.check_output(full_cmd, shell=True, text=True)\\n\\nwith:\\n\\nfull_cmd_list = [sys_command] + params\\noutput = subprocess.check_output(full_cmd_list, text=True)\\n\\nBecause shell=True is the default, no, wait, by default shell is False, so passing the list and not setting shell=True is correct.\\n\\nBut wait, some edge cases: if sys_command or params have elements that include spaces, but then again, subprocess handles that when using a list. For example, if an argument is \\\"file name\\\" with a space, the list element is \\\"file name\\\", which subprocess will handle correctly. But if you join them into a string with spaces and have shell=True, then the shell will split them.\\n\\nSo by moving to a list without shell=True, the command is executed safely without shell injections.\\n\\nSo the fixed code should have:\\n\\nIn the try block:\\n\\nfull_cmd = [sys_command] + params\\n\\noutput = subprocess.check_output(full_cmd, shell=False, text=True)\\n\\nBut also ensure that the command is properly split. Therefore, in the initial parameters, sys_command is supposed to be the base command path/name, and params are a list of arguments.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct line would be as described.\\n\\nNow, let's adjust the code accordingly. The function definition is okay, but the dangerous part is constructing the full command. Replace the f-string and shell=True with passing a list.\\n\\nAlso, what about if sys_command is a list in some cases? No, the function's parameters specify sys_command is a string. So the correct way is to take the sys_command string and the params list and form a single list by concatenation.\\n\\nAnother thing: user input. But the parameters are user-specified, so if they can control sys_command and params, but with the fixed code, using the list approach, it's safer. Because you can't inject commands via parameters as each entry is one argument.\\n\\nHowever, if the user can control the sys_command itself (e.g., set it to another command), then the problem is different. For example, if they can specify any sys_command like \\\"rm\\\", then that's a problem. But the function is intended to let the user specify arguments to the command, but perhaps in the calling code, sys_command is controlled. The function's current setup doesn't address that, but that's beyond the current vulnerability. The current task is to fix the command injection in the way parameters are handled.\\n\\nThus, the fixed code would look like:\\n\\ndef call_system_command(sys_command, params):\\n    try:\\n        full_cmd = [sys_command] + params\\n        output = subprocess.check_output(full_cmd, text=True)\\n        return output.strip()\\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Command execution failed: {e}\\\")\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Error executing command: {str(e)}\\\")\\n\\nWait, text=True is available in Python 3.7+. But assuming that's acceptable.\\n\\nBut the problem with the code crossing platforms? I think that's a separate concern.\\n\\nBut the Bandit warning was about shell=True, which is fixed by using a list and avoiding shell=True. So this should resolve the issue B602.\\n\\nAnother thing to check: When using subprocess.check_output with a list, the first argument is the executable path. If the path contains spaces, it will be split. So the original code may have issues if sys_command is something like '/path/with space/executable', but as a string. But when you create the list [sys_command], it will be one element. So subprocess will handle that correctly.

That way, the arguments are handled properly and the shell isn't invoked, which prevents injection.\\n\\nLooking at the original code, they create full_command by joining cmd_name and cmd_args, then pass it with shell=True.

The original line was full_command = f\\\"{cmd_name} {' '.join(cmd_args)}\\\", which uses a string. Instead, I'll make it full_command = [cmd_name] + cmd_args.

However, if the user is supposed to pass \\\"cmd_name\\\" as the executable, maybe even with a path, but not including arguments, then as long as the function is designed properly, it should be safe.\\n\\nBy creating a list [cmd_name] + cmd_args, we ensure that each argument is properly separated, avoiding shell injection.

Then, in subprocess.check_output, we pass this list and remove shell=True (or set to False).\\n\\nTesting: For example, if cmd_name is 'echo' and cmd_args is ['hello; rm -rf /'], when we join as a string with shell=True, the ';' would execute a new command.

The main fix is constructing the command as a list and avoiding the shell.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would look like this: create full_command by combining the cmd_name as a list element followed by cmd_args, then use check_output with that list and no shell=True.

Because secrets uses a cryptographically strong PRNG, which is suitable for passwords and tokens.\\n\\nLet me look at the original code.

Wait, looking at the original code's line:\\n\\nalphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n\\nBut in the code given, there's the line:\\n\\nimport random\\n\\nso probably, string is imported somewhere. But wait, looking at the code:\\n\\nNo, in the vulnerable code, the code starts with 'def generate_token_code(count: int) -\\u003e str:', then inside the function, they import random, and then use string.ascii_letters and string.digits.\\n\\nWait, but where is 'string' imported? Oh right, the code as provided just has 'import string' missing? Wait no, the code given might be missing the import of string. Because in the vulnerable code:\\n\\nThey have 'import random' inside the function, and then 'alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits'.\\n\\nBut string hasn't been imported. That's an error. Wait, but maybe in the actual code there is an import statement for string that's not shown here. Wait the code provided is:\\n\\ndef generate_token_code(count: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG\\n    import random\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=count))\\n\\nSo this code would actually raise a NameError because 'string' is not imported. So perhaps the original code has an import string somewhere else. But since the user provided code has that error, perhaps it's a mistake. So when fixing, I need to add the import for string as well. Because the code as written would crash because string isn't imported.\\n\\nWait, but the code here is supposed to be as is. So the original code probably has an import string at the top, but maybe not. Wait in the given code, the lines 7-8 are from the Bandit report. The code as given might have been missing import string. So perhaps the fixed code needs to include import string, along with importing secrets.\\n\\nWait, but let's structure the corrected code properly. Let me look:\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\ndef generate_token_code(count: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG\\n    import random\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=count))\\n\\nThe code has an import random inside the function. So alphabet is using string.ascii_letters, which would require that the code has an import string somewhere. But in the code given, there's no such import. So that's another bug. But maybe the user didn't include the full code. So to fix all problems, the corrected code must import both secrets and string.\\n\\nWait the code in the original function starts with:\\n\\nSo the vulnerabilities:\\n\\n1. The use of random.choices which is insecure.\\n\\nThe Bandit result points to the line 8, return ''.join(random.choices(...)).\\n\\nSo the correct fix is to use secrets instead of random. However, since secrets does not have a choices function with 'k' parameter, perhaps replace the random.choices with a list comprehension. So each character is selected using secrets.choice(alphabet) in a loop, count times.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would use secrets instead of random. But the code also needs to import secrets.\\n\\nSo, adjusted code:\\n\\nFirst, we need to import required modules. Since the original code didn't have an import of string, perhaps that was omitted, but the code uses string. So the real code would need to import string. So the fixed code would add 'import string' inside or outside the function. But in the original code, alphabet is created using string.ascii_letters, which implies that the code has 'import string' somewhere. If not, the current code would not work.\\n\\nSo the possible solution:\\n\\ndef generate_token_code(count: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import secrets\\n    import string\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(count))\\n\\nBecause secrets.choice is cryptographically safe. So we're joining the results of secrets.choice(alphabet) called count times.\\n\\nAlso, replacing the import of random with secrets, and adding import string if necessary. But according to the original code's structure, they had 'import random' inside the function. So the fixed code should import secrets inside the function, similarly. Although the import for string. It would be better to have 'import string' at the top of the function, as the original code is missing that, leading to a NameError otherwise.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code would need:\\n\\nImports for 'string', since alphabet uses it.\\n\\nSo here's the corrected code step by step:\\n\\n1. Remove the import of random, and import secrets.\\n\\nInside the function:\\n\\nimport secrets\\n\\nAlso, since alphabet uses string, there should be import string. Since the original code didn't include that, leading to an error, we need to add it. So inside the function, add import string.\\n\\nWait, or maybe the function should have import string at the beginning.\\n\\nWait the original code has:\\n\\nInside the function:\\n\\nimport random\\n\\nthen creates alphabet with string.ascii_letters. So they probably have an import outside? But that doesn't align with Python's scoping. If the code has import string at the top, outside the function, then inside the function, they can use it. But in the code provided, there's no import string in the given snippet, leading to name 'string' is not defined error.\\n\\nSo the original code has an error (missing import string). But fixing that is part of the code correction. Hmm, but according to the user's problem statement, they just provided the function, so the missing import is an error in the code.\\n\\nSo the fixed code should include the necessary imports.\\n\\nSo the final corrected code will need to import string inside the function, or better, at the top. Wait, but in Python, it's standard practice to have imports at the top. But the original code imports random inside the function, perhaps for some reason. It's best to move the imports to the top. But maybe the original code had the necessary imports elsewhere. However, given that the user's code is presented as a function, perhaps the correct code to submit must make it self-contained.\\n\\nSo the fixed code will have to import string.\\n\\nThus, in the function:\\n\\nNow, the corrected code:\\n\\ndef generate_token_code(count: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import secrets\\n    import string\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(count))\\n\\nThis avoids using random, imports secrets, and uses secrets.choice in a loop for each of count characters. Also added import string to avoid NameError.\\n\\nSo this should resolve the Bandit issue, since we're not using random anymore, but secrets, which is secure.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":323,\"completion_tokens\":1838,\"total_tokens\":2161},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The issue is B605, which is about starting a process with a shell. The problem here is the use of os.system(command) where the command is built by string formatting, making it susceptible to shell injection attacks.\\n\\nSo, looking at the code, the command is constructed by f\\\"pandoc {input_md_path} -o {output_pdf_path}\\\". If either input_md_path or output_pdf_path have spaces or special characters, they could be interpreted by the shell, leading to potential command injection.\\n\\nBandit suggests avoiding shell=True and using subprocess.run instead. The correct approach would be to use subprocess module with a list of arguments, thus avoiding the shell entirely.\\n\\nFirst, I'll replace os.system with subprocess.run. Also, instead of building a command string, I should split the command into a list of arguments. So the command list would be ['pandoc', input_md_path, '-o', output_pdf_path].\\n\\nBut wait, when using subprocess.run, I need to handle exit codes. os.system returns the exit code directly, so with subprocess, I can check the returncode attribute.\\n\\nHere's how to modify the code:\\n\\nChange the import to include subprocess if it's not already there. Oh, the current code doesn't show an import for subprocess, so I need to add that. Or wait, maybe os is already imported since the code uses os.path.exists.\\n\\nSo replacing os.system with subprocess.run. Now, constructing the command as a list instead of a single string.\\n\\nOriginal command:\\ncommand = f\\\"pandoc {input_md_path} -o {output_pdf_path}\\\"\\n\\nConvert to list:\\ncommand = ['pandoc', input_md_path, '-o', output_pdf_path]\\n\\nThen, call subprocess.run(command, check=False) and capture the exit code via the returncode.\\n\\nBut wait, when we use shell=False (which is the default), the arguments are passed directly to the process without shell interpretation, so any special characters in the file paths are handled safely.\\n\\nAlso, need to capture the exit code. So exit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode.\\n\\nAlso, the logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command) would log the list as a string, which might look a bit odd. So maybe join the command elements into a string for logging purposes. For example, ' '.join(command). But the original code logs the command string, so to keep the logging similar, perhaps log the actual command that was executed. Alternatively, log the command list as a string, but it's better to log the way it's executed. Hmm.\\n\\nBut for the vulnerability fix, the key part is changing to subprocess.run without shell=True. So in the fixed code:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(['pandoc', input_md_path, '-o', output_pdf_path]).returncode\\n\\nOr:\\n\\ncommand = ['pandoc', input_md_path, '-o', output_pdf_path]\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", ' '.join(command))\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode\\n\\nThat way, the command is logged as a string (same as before but without shell), and the execution is done safely without shell injection.\\n\\nAdditionally, since the user is building the command with input parameters that are paths, if those paths have spaces or special characters, using the list form properly passes them as arguments without needing to shell escape, which is handled correctly by subprocess.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code will use subprocess.run with a list of arguments instead of a shell command string. Also, handle the exit code properly.\\n\\nAnother thing to note: The original code returns early if the file extension is not .md, but the function's return type isn't specified (it's a function returning None probably). The error case logger.error(\\\"Invalid file type: %s\\\", input_md_path) followed by return could leave the function early, which is okay.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would import subprocess, use subprocess.run with the list, log the command string by joining, and capture the exit code.\\n\\nNow checking potential other vulnerabilities. The code checks if the input file exists and has a .md extension. But perhaps the real issue is using the shell. Fixing that should address Bandit's B605.\\n\\nThus, putting it all together:\\n\\nReplacing os.system with subprocess.run and structuring the command as a list. Handle the logging of the command string by joining the list elements.\\n\\nHere's the complete fixed function:\\n\\nThey need to import subprocess if not already imported. But since the original code might have it hidden, but in the original code given, no import is shown. Assuming that the code has the necessary imports, or we should add it. Wait, the original code uses os.system, which requires 'import os'. The user's code likely has os imported already.\\n\\nSo in the fixed code, we need to use subprocess instead of os.system.\\n\\nFinal code steps:\\n\\nImport subprocess (make sure it's present in the code).\\n\\nChange the command construction to a list.\\n\\nReplace os.system with subprocess.run and capture the return code.\\n\\nHere's the corrected code:\\n\\ndef convert_md_to_pdf(input_md_path: str, output_pdf_path: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Converts a markdown file to a PDF using pandoc.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Converting markdown file to PDF...\\\")\\n    if not os.path.exists(input_md_path):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Markdown file not found: %s\\\", input_md_path)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"Markdown file not found: {input_md_path}\\\")\\n    if not input_md_path.endswith('.md'):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Invalid file type: %s\\\", input_md_path)\\n        return\\n    command = ['pandoc', input_md_path, '-o', output_pdf_path]\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", ' '.join(command))\\n    result = subprocess.run(command)\\n    exit_code = result.returncode\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Markdown converted to PDF successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to convert markdown to PDF; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n\\nBut need to ensure that subprocess is imported. So in the code, we need to add 'import subprocess' if not present.\\n\\nAssuming the original code had necessary imports, but in the given code snippet, only os is needed for os.path.exists and os.system. So in the fixed code, 'import subprocess' should be added. Therefore, in the corrected code at the top, possibly:\\n\\nimport os\\nimport subprocess\\n\\nSo integrating all that.\\n\\nAlso, need to adjust the logging of the command from the string to the joined list. By using ' '.join(command), which reconstructs the shell command as a string for logging purposes. So the log message is the same as before but generated safely.\\n\\nThis should prevent shell injection and address Bandit's B605 issue.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":485,\"completion_tokens\":1694,\"total_tokens\":2179},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The problem is that exec can execute arbitrary code, which is dangerous.\\n\\nSo, the goal is to allow only non-harmful operations. How can I restrict what the user's script can do?\\n\\nHmm, maybe using a restricted environment with limited globals. Like, override the __builtins__ to remove dangerous functions. Also, maybe use a whitelist of allowed functions.\\n\\nWait, Python's exec has a parameters for globals and locals. If I can create a custom globals dict that doesn't include unsafe modules or functions, that might help.\\n\\nSo the idea is to create a sandbox environment where the executed code can only access safe built-ins. Overriding __builtins__ to an empty dict or a controlled subset.\\n\\nBut even that might not be enough. Some built-in functions can still be dangerous. For example, file operations, os module, etc. So the whitelist approach is better.\\n\\nLet me start by defining allowed_builtins. Like, maybe only allowing certain safe functions like len, str, int, etc.\\n\\nCreate a new globals dictionary that includes only the allowed built-ins. Then pass this as the globals parameter to exec.\\n\\nSo, inside safe_run_script:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {'__builtins__': {'safe_builtins_here'}}\\nBut how to restrict __builtins__ completely except for some allowed ones?\\n\\nAlternatively, set __builtins__ to None and add specific allowed functions. Wait, if __builtins__ is None, then no access to any built-ins. But the user script might need some.\\n\\nSo in the custom globals, let's start by clearing __builtins__ and then adding only necessary safe ones.\\n\\nWait, here's how to approach: create a dict for globals where __builtins__ is a limited set. Like:\\n\\nsafe_globals = {\\n    '__builtins__': {\\n        'None': None,\\n        'bool': bool,\\n        'int': int,\\n        'float': float,\\n        'str': str,\\n        'list': list,\\n        'tuple': tuple,\\n        'dict': dict,\\n        'len': len,\\n        'range': range,\\n        'print': print,  # Maybe allow print, unless it's considered harmless?\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nWait, but even print could be used in DoS by printing a lot, but the problem states 'non-harmful operations', so perhaps allowing it. However, the key is to prevent access to file system, os, subprocess, etc.\\n\\nSo by limiting the builtins to only certain functions and types, and not including modules like os or sys. But how can the user code access those if the builtins don't include them?\\n\\nBut if __builtins__ are limited, then the user script can't import modules because the __import__ function is part of __builtins__.\\n\\nAh, important! The default __builtins__ includes __import__, which allows importing modules. So we need to remove __import__ from the available builtins.\\n\\nThus, in our safe_globals, the __builtins__ dictionary should not include __import__, or other dangerous functions.\\n\\nSo when building the safe_globals, replace __builtins__ with a dict that has only the allowed functions, and exclude things like __import__, open, eval, exec, etc.\\n\\nTherefore, the exec would be called with the safe_globals. Then the user's script can't access dangerous modules or functions because they can't import them, and the builtins available are restricted.\\n\\nAdditionally, to prevent the code from modifying the globals, set the exec's globals to a copy that doesn't allow modifications. Or make the safe_globals a read-only structure.\\n\\nWait, perhaps using the technique where the global namespace is a separate dict with no access to system modules.\\n\\nLet me try putting this into code.\\n\\nIn the function safe_run_script:\\n\\nDefine a restricted_globals dictionary that allows a subset of safe built-ins and no __import__.\\n\\nMaybe like this:\\n\\ndef safe_run_script(script_code: str):\\n    restricted_globals = {\\n        '__builtins__': {\\n            'None': None,\\n            'bool': bool,\\n            'int': int,\\n            'float': float,\\n            'str': str,\\n            'list': list,\\n            'tuple': tuple,\\n            'dict': dict,\\n            'len': len,\\n            'range': range,\\n            'print': print,\\n        }\\n    }\\n    exec(script_code, restricted_globals)\\n    return None\\n\\nWait, but when you set __builtins__ to a custom dict, it actually restricts the built-in functions. Because in Python, when you override __builtins__ in a module's globals, you limit what's available. But in the exec context, specifying this restricted_globals would prevent the code from accessing dangerous functions.\\n\\nThis would make it so that any code executed through exec cannot import modules, since there's no __import__ function available, nor can they access things like open, os, etc., because those are part of the standard built-ins which we're not including.\\n\\nHowever, even this might not be fully secure. For example, the user could access object.__subclasses__() to find potentially dangerous classes. But handling such advanced bypasses is more complex. But the question states to prevent 'only non-harmful operations', so maybe a basic level of restriction is expected here.\\n\\nAdditionally, certain built-ins like exec or eval should not be included. Wait, in our example, the __builtins__ dict that we're passing doesn't include those.\\n\\nWait, in the restricted_globals __builtins__, the keys are the ones we specify. The original __builtins__ in Python is a module (in some environments, it's a dict). So by replacing __builtins__ with our own dict containing allowed functions, the user script's built-ins would only have what we have added here.\\n\\nSo in this setup, if they try to call open(), they would get a NameError because open is not present in our __builtins__ dict. Similarly, they can't import anything because the __builtins__ doesn't have __import__.\\n\\nSo this should severely restrict what the user's code can do. Of course, some functions like print and len are allowed, which are generally harmless.\\n\\nBut is there a way for users to escape this sandbox? Possibly, but given that the task is to do a basic fix to the exec_used vulnerability by restricting the execution environment, this might suffice.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code would use the exec with a restricted_globals that limits built-ins to a safe subset.\\n\\nTesting this, if a user provides a script_code like 'import os', they should get an error like NameError: name 'import' is not defined, because __import__ is not available.\\n\\nAnother example: if the code tries to do open('file.txt'), it would raise a NameError because open is not in the allowed built-ins.\\n\\nTherefore, this approach mitigates the exec_used vulnerability by constraining the execution environment.\\n\\nAnother possible approach is to set the __builtins__ to None, but that limits all built-in functions. However, some minimal built-ins are useful. It depends on how restrictive we need to be.\\n\\nAlternatively, there are more secure ways, but given that Bandit's warning is about using exec with user input, the solution needs to limit the scope of what the executed code can do.\\n\\nThus, the fixed code would use exec with a restricted global namespace.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":259,\"completion_tokens\":1692,\"total_tokens\":1951},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit report says to use ast.literal_eval instead because eval can execute arbitrary code, which is a security risk. But wait, the original code's purpose is to evaluate user queries as Python expressions. So replacing eval with literal_eval might not work if the user needs to use expressions that aren't literals. Hmm, the description says the user-defined logic can be executed, which suggests that maybe they are expecting more than just literals.\\n\\nWait, the question states that the function should evaluate the user's query as a Python expression. But using eval on user input is dangerous. So how can I make this secure? The problem is here: using eval directly allows execution of any code, which is a major security flaw, especially if the user input is untrusted. So maybe the answer is to restrict what the user can input, but that's not straightforward.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the application requires allowing mathematical expressions or certain operations, perhaps we can use a safer way to evaluate them. ast.literal_eval can only evaluate literals like strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, etc., but not expressions involving operators or function calls. So if the user_query is something like \\\"2 + 3\\\", literal_eval wouldn't work because that's an expression, not a literal. So replacing eval with literal_eval might break the functionality intended by QUIZAPP.\\n\\nThis is a conflict. The original code uses eval to evaluate user-defined logic, but it's unsafe. The security issue is high, so I need to find a way to safely evaluate user input. Maybe the correct approach is to use a restricted environment for eval. For example, limiting the globals and locals dictionaries to only allow certain functions or operations. That way, even if the user input includes malicious code, it doesn't have access to dangerous functions.\\n\\nSo, the fix would involve modifying the eval call to use a restricted namespace. Like, passing {'__builtins__': None} as the globals parameter, and perhaps a limited locals dictionary. But then, for mathematical expressions, they might need access to some math functions, which complicates things. Alternatively, using a library like asteval that safely evaluates expressions.\\n\\nWait, but the user's task is to fix the code according to the Bandit results, which suggests using ast.literal_eval. However, if the user's application requires evaluating expressions beyond literals, then using ast.literal_eval isn't enough and the problem might need a different approach. The Bandit report might be providing a general suggestion, but maybe in this specific case, the requirements make it so that eval is necessary but needs to be made more secure.\\n\\nAlternatively, the fix could use ast.literal_eval if the application can work with that. But let me re-examine the original code's comments. The purpose is to let users design quizzes where their custom logic is executed. So maybe they are allowed to have more complex expressions. If eval is necessary, then perhaps using a more secure approach with Ryon's answer's \\\"safe eval\\\" methods, like removing builtins.\\n\\nSo the secure way here would be to pass a minimal environment to eval. For example, removing access to built-in functions and modules. Setting the __builtins__ to None in the globals dictionary when calling eval.\\n\\nSo modifying the code as:\\n\\nresult = eval(user_query, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n\\nBut I need to test if this would work. But the problem is that even then, some attacks could still be possible. However, maybe this reduces the risk. But it's not completely safe. But according to the problem statement, maybe that's beyond the scope here and the main fix suggested by Bandit is to use literal_eval.\\n\\nBut evaluating the code's intention: if the function is supposed to evaluate any Python expression (like 2+3*4), then literal_eval can't do that. So maybe the correct approach is to use a controlled environment with eval, which is the best possible given the constraints. So, how can we make eval safer here?\\n\\nAlternatively, if the application allows the user to input their own code, then there's a security trade-off. Eval is risky, but the functionality might require it. If the application must accept arbitrary expressions but needs to secure against attacks, perhaps only basic mathematical operations are allowed, and disabling builtins. But this isn't foolproof either.\\n\\nIn the context of the Bandit finding, the recommendation is to replace eval with ast.literal_eval. So perhaps the intended answer is to make that substitution. However, doing so might limit functionality.\\n\\nWait, looking at the initial code:\\n\\nThe user input is evaluated, and the function returns the result. So if the user input is something like \\\"os.system('rm -rf /')\\\", using eval would execute that command. But if they use ast.literal_eval, that input would raise an error, so literal_eval is safer. However, literal_eval can't evaluate expressions like '2+3'; it can only evaluate literals. So for example, '2 + 3' is a BinOp in AST terms, which isn't allowed by literal_eval.\\n\\nSo, maybe the problem requires allowing mathematical operations, but that makes using eval a necessity. However, the security flaw should be addressed by using a safer method.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps in the code's intended use-case, the user queries are supposed to be mathematical expressions that can be evaluated safely. So, maybe using a parser for mathematical expressions instead of eval, but the code uses eval for simplicity.\\n\\nGiven that the code currently uses eval and Bandit's suggestion is to use ast.literal_eval, perhaps the correct solution is to do that, but that would make the code unable to compute expressions. However, if the original functionality is misunderstood, this might not be the case.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer could be replacing eval with ast.literal_eval. So:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef process_user_input(user_query: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        result = ast.literal_eval(user_query)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut then, this code would only support literals, not expressions. So in the example where user_input is \\\"2 + 3\\\", this would throw an error. However, in that case, the developer would have to use a different approach.\\n\\nWait, but wait. Does the problem allow us to change the approach or just fix the vulnerability? The task is to fix the vulnerability according to the Bandit analysis. The vulnerability is using eval, and the suggested fix is to use ast.literal_eval. However, the problem's description says that user-defined logic can be executed. So, that would include evaluating expressions, which eval allows. literal_eval doesn't.\\n\\nBut maybe the correct answer here is to restrict the code to use literal_eval, even though that might change the functionality. But in the absence of further context, perhaps that is the expected solution.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the QUIZAPP's intended functionality is to evaluate expressions (like mathematical ones), then using literal_eval isn't sufficient, so another approach is needed.\\n\\nBut given that the Bandit report's recommendation is explicit—using ast.literal_eval as a safer alternative—the correct answer might just be to make that substitution, regardless of the functionality change. However, the user didn't mention anything about the expected functionality change. So, in the context of the code vulnerability exercise, the fix is to replace eval with ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nThus, the code is updated as follows. But need to import ast.\\n\\nLooking back at the original code: the original code doesn't import ast. So, the fixed code needs to import it.\\n\\nYes. So the revised code would be:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef process_user_input(user_query: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        result = ast.literal_eval(user_query)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut now, if the user_query is a legitimate expression like \\\"2 + 3\\\", ast.literal_eval cannot parse it and will raise an error. Thus, the function would return \\\"Error!\\\".\\n\\nThat's a breaking change compared to the original code's intended functionality. However, the security vulnerability is fixed. This suggests that there's a trade-off between functionality and security here. But given that the user's task is to fix the security vulnerability, as per Bandit's report, the correct fix is to use ast.literal_eval. Therefore, the answer involves making that replacement, along with importing ast.\\n\\nBut since the original code might expect users to input expressions, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. But in the problem's instruction, the Bandit report directly points to using ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nThus, the fixed code should follow the Bandit recommendation, despite the possible functionality change. Therefore, the code replaces eval with ast.literal_eval.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":302,\"completion_tokens\":1900,\"total_tokens\":2202},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The problem is using eval, which is insecure. Let's see. The code is generating a lambda that applies eval on the where clause conditions. Using eval here is dangerous because someone could inject malicious code into the SQL-like statement's WHERE clause.\\n\\nSo instead of using eval, I should parse the WHERE clause safely. The conditions in the WHERE clause are split by AND, and each condition should be checked against the row data safely. Maybe I can split each condition into parts that can be evaluated without using eval.\\n\\nEach condition in the WHERE clause is probably something like 'age \\u003e 20', or 'name == \\\"Alice\\\"'. So I need to parse each part of the condition. Instead of evaluating them as code, I can break them into field, operator, and value.\\n\\nFor example, for a condition like 'age \\u003e 30', parse field as 'age', operator as '\\u003e', and value as 30. Then in the filtering function, compare row['age'] \\u003e 30. But how do I handle different operators? Maybe using a dictionary that maps operator strings to the corresponding comparison functions.\\n\\nSo, step by step:\\n\\n1. Instead of joining the conditions with ' and ' and evaling, parse each condition into its components.\\n2. For each condition, split into left-hand side (field), operator, and right-hand side (value).\\n3. Create a list of functions that check each condition on a row.\\n4. In the filtering function, check if all conditions are met using these parsed functions.\\n\\nBut parsing the conditions could be complex. Need to split on operators like ==, !=, \\u003c=, \\u003e=, \\u003c, \\u003e. Maybe use a regular expression to capture these parts.\\n\\nAnother approach: use a safe evaluator that only accesses the row's keys and performs comparisons. Perhaps using operator module functions and comparing the row's values directly.\\n\\nWait, what if we use a library like ast to parse the expressions? Or perhaps use a lambda that uses the row's items in a safe way. But that might get complicated.\\n\\nAlternatively, convert the condition into a function that uses safe evaluation by breaking down the parts. Like for each condition, split it into field, operator, value, then apply the corresponding check.\\n\\nThis way, the code doesn't evaluate arbitrary expressions. Only supported operators would be allowed.\\n\\nLet's try modifying the code to build a list of conditions that are checked against each row. Let's process each query_condition individually:\\n\\nFor each condition in query_conditions:\\n\\n- Split it into components. Let's parse using regular expressions to get the field name, operator, and value.\\n\\nExample regex pattern: (\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.*)\\n\\nBut the value part might be a string (in quotes) or a number. So after extracting the value, we'd need to parse it. For example, if the value is in quotes, it's a string. Otherwise, check if it's a number.\\n\\nSo, for each condition in query_conditions:\\n\\n1. Use a regex to parse into field, op, val_str.\\n2. Convert val_str into the actual value (int, float, or string).\\n3. Create a lambda function that checks if row[field] (with proper conversion?) matches the operation with the value.\\n\\nBut how to handle different data types correctly? For example, the row's field might be a string or a number, and the condition's value needs to be of the same type.\\n\\nMaybe assume that the row's data is stored with proper types, and convert the val_str accordingly. So, val_str can be a number (try converting to int or float) or a string (if enclosed in quotes).\\n\\nProcessing the val_str:\\n\\nIf val_str is enclosed in single or double quotes, it's a string. Otherwise, check if it's a numeric value.\\n\\nSo code for processing each condition:\\n\\nimport re\\nfrom operator import eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge\\n\\noperators = {\\n    '==': eq,\\n    '!=': ne,\\n    '\\u003c': lt,\\n    '\\u003c=': le,\\n    '\\u003e': gt,\\n    '\\u003e=': ge\\n}\\n\\ndef parse_condition(condition):\\n    # Regex to split into parts\\n    pattern = r\\\"^\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.*?)\\\\s*$\\\"\\n    match = re.match(pattern, condition)\\n    if not match:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid condition: {condition}\\\")\\n    field, op, val_str = match.groups()\\n    # Parse value\\n    if val_str.startswith(('\\\"', \\\"'\\\")) and val_str.endswith(('\\\"', \\\"'\\\")):\\n        val = val_str[1:-1]\\n    else:\\n        try:\\n            val = int(val_str)\\n        except ValueError:\\n            try:\\n                val = float(val_str)\\n            except ValueError:\\n                raise ValueError(f\\\"Could not parse value {val_str}\\\")\\n    if op not in operators:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator {op}\\\")\\n    return field, op, val\\n\\nThen for each condition in query_conditions:\\n\\nparsed = parse_condition(condition.strip())\\nfield, op, val = parsed\\nfunc = operators[op]\\ncheck = lambda row, f=field, o=op, v=val: operators[o](row[f], v)\\n\\nCollect all these check functions for each condition. Then the filter function would be a lambda row that all(checks for the row).\\n\\nWait, maybe collect a list of functions, each checking a condition. Then combine them with 'and'.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nfilter_checks = []\\nfor cond in query_conditions:\\n    cond = cond.strip()\\n    field, op, val = parse_condition(cond)\\n    op_func = operators[op]\\n    # Create a lambda that checks row[field] against val using op_func\\n    # Note: need to capture the current values of field, op_func, val in the lambda\\n    filter_checks.append(lambda row, f=field, of=op_func, v=val: of(row.get(f), v))\\n    # Also handle the case where the field might not exist? Maybe the original code assumes fields exist, so proceed the same way.\\n\\nThen, filtering_function = lambda row: all(check(row) for check in filter_checks)\\n\\nThis way, instead of dynamically evaluating a string with eval, each condition is parsed and converted into a list of specific checks. This avoids code injection.\\n\\nSo integrating this into the code:\\n\\nFirst, split the where_clause into query_conditions.\\n\\nThen parse each condition, create the filter_checks list.\\n\\nReplace the current line that builds the eval string with this new approach.\\n\\nBut implementing this requires adding the parse_condition function and operators dict inside submit_user_query.\\n\\nSo updating the code steps:\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\n        query_conditions = where_clause.split('AND')\\n        # WARNING: This is vulnerable to code injection\\n        filtering_function = lambda row: eval(' and '.join(query_conditions), row)\\n\\nWe need to replace this.\\n\\nReplace with:\\n\\n        # Process WHERE clause safely\\n        query_conditions = [cond.strip() for cond in where_clause.split('AND')]\\n        \\n        # Parse each condition\\n        filter_functions = []\\n        operators = {\\n            '==': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n            '!=': lambda a, b: a != b,\\n            '\\u003c': lambda a, b: a \\u003c b,\\n            '\\u003c=': lambda a, b: a \\u003c= b,\\n            '\\u003e': lambda a, b: a \\u003e b,\\n            '\\u003e=': lambda a, b: a \\u003e= b\\n        }\\n        \\n        for cond in query_conditions:\\n            # Parse condition into field, operator, value\\n            # Using regex\\n            pattern = r\\\"^\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.*)$\\\"\\n            match = re.match(pattern, cond)\\n            if not match:\\n                raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid condition: {cond}\\\")\\n            field, op, val_str = match.groups()\\n            # Handle value (e.g., '5' or '\\\"Alice\\\"')\\n            if val_str.startswith((\\\"'\\\", '\\\"')) and val_str.endswith((\\\"'\\\", '\\\"')) and len(val_str) \\u003e=2:\\n                val = val_str[1:-1]\\n            else:\\n                # Try converting to int or float\\n                try:\\n                    val = int(val_str)\\n                except ValueError:\\n                    try:\\n                        val = float(val_str)\\n                    except ValueError:\\n                        val = val_str  # maybe a boolean or other, but as string?\\n            \\n            if op not in operators:\\n                raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator in condition: {cond}\\\")\\n            \\n            # Create a function to check this condition\\n            def check_condition(row, f=field, o=op, v=val):\\n                return operators[o](row[f], v)\\n            \\n            filter_functions.append(check_condition)\\n        \\n        # Combine all conditions with AND (all must be True)\\n        filtering_function = lambda row: all(fn(row) for fn in filter_functions)\\n        \\nBut do the lambdas capture the current values correctly? Since the loop variables (field, op, val) change each iteration, the lambda may capture the final values only. This is a classic Python closure issue. So, to fix that, we need to bind the current values in the lambda.\\n\\nYes, that's right. The way to handle this is to set the default parameters in the lambda to capture the current values during each iteration. Because default parameter values are evaluated at function definition time, capturing the current values.\\n\\nSo using default parameters in check_condition as done in the code (f=field, o=op, v=val) would capture those values in each loop iteration. Thus, each check_condition will use the correct field, op, and val for that condition.\\n\\nTherefore, the filtering_function will apply all the conditions safely.\\n\\nNow, replacing the vulnerable eval line with this code should eliminate the injection vulnerability. That way, the code uses safe parsing of the conditions without evaluating arbitrary code.\\n\\nAnother point: The original code used eval with the row as the locals dictionary. So the row's fields were available as variables. For example, if the row has a 'name' key, then the condition would be evaluated as 'name == \\\"Alice\\\"'. We need to replicate this by comparing row['name'] with \\\"Alice\\\".\\n\\nBy parsing each condition into field, operator, value, our check_condition function does exactly that. For example, 'name == \\\"Alice\\\"' becomes checking row['name'] == 'Alice'.\\n\\nThis approach is safe as long as the conditions are parsed correctly. This removes the use of eval, thus preventing any arbitrary code execution.\\n\\nNow, test case considerations: For a query like \\\"SELECT name FROM data WHERE age \\u003e 25 ORDER BY name\\\", the where clause 'age \\u003e25' would be parsed into 'age' as field, '\\u003e' as operator, 25 as value. Then, in filter_functions, the check_condition is expecting row['age'] \\u003e25.\\n\\nThis should work correctly.\\n\\nPotential edge cases:\\n\\n1. Other operators: need to support all possible operators in the SQL-like query. The code currently handles ==, !=, \\u003c, \\u003c=, \\u003e, \\u003e=.\\n\\n2. Values that have spaces, e.g., where the value part is a string with quotes. For example, name == \\\"John Doe\\\".\\n\\nThe regex pattern r\\\"^\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.*)$\\\" matches the entire value part. The capture group for val_str takes everything after the operator. Then, if the value is in quotes, we extract it. This should handle strings with spaces.\\n\\nBut what if someone uses an operator that we don't support? Then the regex would fail to match, and it raises an error, which is better than allowing arbitrary code.\\n\\nThus, the main code will raise a ValueError for invalid conditions, as before.\\n\\nNow, the updated code replaces the eval part with parsed conditions and safe comparisons.\\n\\nAnother point: The original code may have handled expressions like 'salary \\u003e= 50000' or 'status == \\\"active\\\"'. The new code should also handle these, assuming the value parsing is correct.\\n\\nNow, integrating this into the submit_user_query function. Need to modify the part after where_clause splitting.\\n\\nSo, the steps are:\\n\\n1. Split query_conditions on 'AND'.\\n\\n2. For each condition in query_conditions:\\n\\n   a. Parse using regex into field, operator, val_str.\\n\\n   b. Parse val_str into a value (string, int, or float).\\n\\n   c. Create a check function using the operator from the operators dict.\\n\\n3. Combine all check functions into a filtering function that applies all checks.\\n\\nThis approach avoids using eval and makes the code secure.\\n\\nLet me update the submit_user_query code accordingly.\\n\\nOriginal code snippet:\\n\\ndef submit_user_query(records, sql_statement):\\n    try:\\n        # Parse the query\\n        match = re.match(r\\\"SELECT (.*) FROM data WHERE (.*) ORDER BY (.*)\\\", sql_statement, re.IGNORECASE)\\n        if not match:\\n            raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid query format\\\")\\n\\n        select_clause, where_clause, order_by_clause = match.groups()\\n\\n        # Process SELECT clause\\n        selected_fields = [field.strip() for field in select_clause.split(',')]\\n\\n        # Process WHERE clause\\n        query_conditions = where_clause.split('AND')\\n        # WARNING: This is vulnerable to code injection\\n        filtering_function = lambda row: eval(' and '.join(query_conditions), row)\\n        # Process ORDER BY clause\\n        order_key = order_by_clause.strip()\\n\\n        # Execute the query\\n        query_result = filter(filtering_function, records)\\n        query_result = sorted(query_result, key=lambda item: item[order_key])\\n        query_result = [{field: item[field] for field in selected_fields} for item in query_result]\\n\\n        return query_result\\n\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Error executing query: {str(e)}\\\")\\n\\nIn the WHERE clause processing section, replace the existing with:\\n\\n        # Process WHERE clause safely\\n        query_conditions = [cond.strip() for cond in where_clause.split('AND')]\\n        filter_functions = []\\n        operators = {\\n            '==': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n            '!=': lambda a, b: a != b,\\n            '\\u003c': lambda a, b: a \\u003c b,\\n            '\\u003c=': lambda a, b: a \\u003c= b,\\n            '\\u003e': lambda a, b: a \\u003e b,\\n            '\\u003e=': lambda a, b: a \\u003e= b\\n        }\\n\\n        for condition in query_conditions:\\n            # Parse each condition into field, operator, and value\\n            pattern = r\\\"^\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.*?)\\\\s*$\\\"\\n            match_cond = re.match(pattern, condition)\\n            if not match_cond:\\n                raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid WHERE clause condition: {condition}\\\")\\n            field, op, val_str = match_cond.groups()\\n            \\n            # Handle value parsing (strings wrapped in '' or \\\"\\\" or numbers)\\n            if (val_str.startswith(\\\"'\\\") and val_str.endswith(\\\"'\\\")) or (val_str.startswith('\\\"') and val_str.endswith('\\\"')):\\n                val = val_str[1:-1]\\n            else:\\n                # Try converting to int or float\\n                try:\\n                    val = int(val_str)\\n                except ValueError:\\n                    try:\\n                        val = float(val_str)\\n                    except ValueError:\\n                        val = val_str  # if not a number, treat as string (though this may lead to issues)\\n\\n            # Check if operator is supported\\n            if op not in operators:\\n                raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator: {op} in condition: {condition}\\\")\\n\\n            # Capture current field, op, val in the lambda's default arguments\\n            filter_functions.append(lambda row, f=field, o=op, v=val: operators[o](row[f], v))\\n\\n        # Combine all conditions\\n        filtering_function = lambda row: all(fn(row) for fn in filter_functions)\\n\\nBut need to make sure that the regular expression captures the entire condition, even with possible spaces. For example, fields with underscores or other valid characters? The regex uses \\\\w+, which matches alphanumeric and underscores, which should match valid Python variable names. That's similar to the original code.\\n\\nNow, let's check the regex again. Oh, the pattern for field allows words (\\\\w+), which is okay. The val_str is captured as (.*?), non-greedy up to whitespace, but maybe that's not right. The original regex in parse condition:\\n\\npattern = r\\\"^\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.*?)\\\\s*$\\\"\\n\\nThe .*? to capture the value part, but using .* can include any characters, including spaces. For example, if the condition is \\\"name == John Doe\\\", then val_str would be \\\"John Doe\\\" (without quotes), which would then be treated as a string during parsing. But in that case, the code would try to convert \\\"John Doe\\\" to int, and if that fails, use as string. However, the user probably needs to enclose such strings in quotes. So, this might lead to issues where intended strings are not enclosed in quotes. However, this is up to the query syntax being handled. The code will process it as a string if it can't convert it to a number.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user is required to provide quotes around string literals in the WHERE clauses, but the regex ensures that. Or we could allow for the rest of the condition after the operator, trimming whitespace.\\n\\nBut in the original vulnerable code, the user could write conditions like \\\"age \\u003e 30\\\", which would be evaluated via eval, where row's 'age' key's value is compared to 30. Now, with the new code, that same condition would parse 'age' as the field, '\\u003e' as the operator, and '30' is parsed to integer 30, so row['age'] is checked as \\u003e30.\\n\\nIf there's a value like 'name == John Doe' (without quotes), the code would parse val_str as 'John Doe', which can't be converted to int/float, so treated as the string 'John Doe'. So the code would check row['name'] == 'John Doe', which would be correct if the actual data has 'John Doe' as the value without quotes. Wait, this's a bit ambiguous.\\n\\nWait, in the original code, using eval: if the where clause is 'name == John' (John without quotes), eval would look for a variable named John, but in the row context, which only contains the row's keys. So, this would have been a mistake. Now, with the new code, if the user writes 'name == John', the code would parse 'John' as a string (since it's not in quotes and isn't a number) and check row['name'] against 'John'. But in reality, the user probably intended to write 'name == \\\"John\\\"'. So there's a difference here.\\n\\nThis suggests that the syntax of the WHERE clauses in the original code required that string literals be passed in quotes. However, because eval was used, the conditions were in Python syntax\"},\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":602,\"completion_tokens\":4096,\"total_tokens\":4698},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis pointed out a high severity issue with B605: starting a process with a shell, which can lead to command injection. Let me look at the code.\\n\\nThe original code uses os.system(command) where the command is a string built with f\\\"pandoc {md_file_path} -o {pdf_file_path}\\\". The problem here is that if md_file_path or pdf_file_path have spaces or special characters, they could be interpreted by the shell, leading to injection attacks.\\n\\nTo fix this, instead of using os.system with a shell, I should use subprocess.run() without shell=True. Also, passing the command as a list of arguments instead of a single string will prevent shell injection.\\n\\nSo first, I'll import subprocess. Then modify the command to be a list: ['pandoc', md_file_path, '-o', pdf_file_path]. Then use subprocess.run with check=False to capture the exit code. Also, using shell=False is the default, but explicit is better.\\n\\nWait, but I should check if the paths have special characters. By using the list form, subprocess will handle each argument properly, even with spaces or quotes. This avoids the shell altogether.\\n\\nThen, replace os.system with subprocess.run. Then check the exit code with exit_code = result.returncode. Also, since the command line is logged, make sure that the logging shows the command. But since command is a list now, logging it as a string might be a problem. Oh wait, in the original code, the command is logged as a string. Let me adjust that. When creating the command list, then the logged command should be a string, like joining the list elements with spaces. But actually, the logger.info line is logging the command variable as is. So in the original, command was a string. If I change command to be a list, I need to log it properly. So maybe, for logging purposes, create a shell-escaped command string. Alternatively, when building the command list, at the same time create a safe string for logging.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe create the command list first, then log by joining the elements. Let me restructure that. So:\\n\\ncommand_list = ['pandoc', md_file_path, '-o', pdf_file_path]\\ncommand_str = ' '.join(shlex.quote(arg) for arg in command_list)\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command_str)\\n\\nBut since we are switching to using subprocess with the list and shell=False, this prevents injection. Also, shlex.quote would handle escaping in the log string so that the logged command is safe to display. Wait, but in the original code they just interpolate the file paths. So maybe ensuring that the logged command looks like the actual executed command. Using shlex.join in Python 3.8+ might help. But to make it compatible, maybe using a list and then joining with quotes where necessary.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the command is now a list, use ' '.join(command_list) to log, but that might not properly escape spaces. But logging the actual arguments as the user intended is better. For example, if the filename has a space, it would appear in the log without quotes, but in reality, it's correctly passed as a single argument to pandoc. So the log would show the actual command parts. Let's proceed.\\n\\nWait, the original code had the command as a string created by f\\\"pandoc {md_file_path} -o {pdf_file_path}\\\", which could mess up filenames with spaces. By switching to a list, those paths are passed directly as arguments without shell processing. The os.system(command) runs the command through the shell, so if md_file_path has something like \\\"; rm -rf /\\\", that's a problem. Using subprocess without shell=True prevents that.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would:\\n\\n1. Change the command to a list. For example, ['pandoc', md_file_path, '-o', pdf_file_path]\\n\\n2. Use subprocess.run instead of os.system. Capture the return code.\\n\\n3. Also, log the command properly. So when logging, perhaps join the command list elements into a string for readability. But how to do that? 'pandoc' 'file name with spaces.md' -o 'output.pdf' as in shell, but the log will show it as \\\"pandoc file name with spaces.md -o output.pdf\\\", which may not be accurate, but in terms of logging, using shlex.join would better represent how it would be written in a shell. Wait, maybe use shlex.quote on each argument when creating the command string. However, in Python 3.8+, shlex has a join function that takes a list and returns a shell-escaped string. To ensure the logged command is properly escaped so that it's safe to display, perhaps using that.\\n\\nSo steps:\\n\\nImport subprocess and shlex.\\n\\ncommand_list = ['pandoc', md_file_path, '-o', pdf_file_path]\\n\\ncommand_str = ' '.join(shlex.quote(arg) for arg in command_list) # Or shlex.join(command_list) in 3.8+\\n\\nThen log command_str.\\n\\nBut maybe generating the command string accurately for logging is better. Let's proceed with that.\\n\\nThen, the code would change the command building part to use a list.\\n\\nOriginal code line 15:\\n\\ncommand = f\\\"pandoc {md_file_path} -o {pdf_file_path}\\\"\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\n\\nChange to:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\n\\ncommand_list = ['pandoc', md_file_path, '-o', pdf_file_path]\\n\\n# Log command as properly quoted string for user visibility.\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", ' '.join(shlex.quote(arg) for arg in command_list))\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run(command_list, check=False)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nThis way, the parameters are passed safely as arguments, no shell is involved, and the logged command shows a properly shell-escaped version.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together.\\n\\nAlso, need to handle any exceptions? Well, the original code doesn't handle exceptions, just checks the exit code.\\n\\nIn the existing code, after running os.system, it checks if exit_code ==0. The same logic can be applied here.\\n\\nSo the corrected code for that part:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command_list).returncode\\n\\nBut then need to capture the result. Wait, for the code:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run(command_list, check=False)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nYes. That's better because subprocess.run returns a CompletedProcess instance, and returncode is the attribute.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would:\\n\\n1. Replace the os.system with subprocess.run.\\n\\n2. Split the command into a list to avoid shell injection.\\n\\n3. Also adjust the logging to show the properly escaped command.\\n\\nNow, the potential problem is in building the command as a list. Ensure that the paths are correctly passed.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code would import subprocess and shlex? Wait, but in the fixed code, shlex is used in joining for the log. Wait, no, shlex is needed to properly escape the command parts when logged. Wait, the logging of the command is to show the actual command that would be run in the shell. But since we're not using the shell anymore, maybe that's not necessary. But the user might still want to log the command as it would be typed into a shell.\\n\\nSo the logging line should use ' '.join(shlex.quote(arg) for arg in command_list) to generate a safe shell command string. However, does the original code's logging include the command in a way that's as the user input or as a safe string?\\n\\nIn the original code, if the user supplies a filename with spaces, it would appear unquoted in the logged command, which is not the same as how it would be executed in the shell (due to the original code's problem). But in the corrected code, we are building the command as a list, which even if the path has spaces, is handled properly. So the logging would log \\\"pandoc file with spaces.md -o output.pdf\\\", which is correct. But how the user knows what command was actually executed. By converting the list into a shell-escaped string for logging, we ensure that the logged command is safe to be executed in a shell. But maybe the logging is just for informational purposes, and the exact command isn't critical. However, preserving the original logging seems desired.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the user might be used to seeing the command as a single string, perhaps the logging can generate a string that represents the command as one might type it in a shell. Using shlex.quote around each argument would do that.\\n\\nTherefore, updating the logging line:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", ' '.join(shlex.quote(c) for c in command_list))\\n\\nThat would properly escape the arguments for the shell. But is shlex imported? Yes, we need to import shlex as well.\\n\\nWait, in the original code, the user hasn't imported shlex. So need to add that. But the code as provided may not have the necessary imports.\\n\\nSo in the fixed code, we need to ensure that subprocess and shlex are imported.\\n\\nWait, looking at the original code, I assume that os and logger are already imported. They probably have necessary imports like os, logging. So in the original code, os is imported (since os.path.exists is used, and os.system). The function uses a logger which is probably from a module-level logger.\\n\\nIn the fixed code, need to import subprocess and possibly shlex.\\n\\nWait, shlex is part of the standard library, so no need for additional installation. So adding:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\nimport shlex\\n\\nBut in the existing code's imports? If these aren't present, then the fixed code would have to include them. However, in the provided code snippet, there's no import statements. Since the user provides the function, it's possible that the necessary modules are already imported. Or maybe the code as given in the problem has no imports, so the helper has to add them.\\n\\nBut in the vulnerable code given at the beginning, there's a function definition. Let's see the original code as provided by the user:\\n\\nThe original code is:\\n\\ndef markdown_to_pdf(md_file_path: str, pdf_file_path: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Converts a markdown file to a PDF using pandoc.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Converting markdown file to PDF...\\\")\\n    if not os.path.exists(md_file_path):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Markdown file not found: %s\\\", md_file_path)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"Markdown file not found: {md_file_path}\\\")\\n    if not md_file_path.endswith('.md'):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Invalid file type: %s\\\", md_file_path)\\n        return\\n    command = f\\\"pandoc {md_file_path} -o {pdf_file_path}\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\n    exit_code = os.system(command)\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Markdown converted to PDF successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to convert markdown to PDF; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n\\nAssuming that os is imported (because of os.path.exists and os.system). But in the corrected code, os.system is replaced by subprocess.run.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code will need to import subprocess and shlex.\\n\\nBut if the user has not included the import lines, the fixed code must include them. However, the original code must already import os and logger, but maybe the user needs to import subprocess and shlex.\\n\\nBut according to the problem statement, the user's answer should include the corrected code. So in the corrected version, we need to include necessary imports.\\n\\nBut in the original code snippet provided by the user, are there any existing imports? The original code starts with a comment, then the function. So probably, the user's code doesn't include the imports. Therefore, the fixed code needs to include the required imports.\\n\\nWait, no. Looking again at the original code:\\n\\nOriginal code begins with the function's comment, then the function definition. No import statements. However, in the function body, there's references to 'os' (os.path.exists, os.system), and 'logger' (logger.info, etc.), so the fixed code must have those in scope.\\n\\nBut since the user is supposed to provide a fixed code that can replace the original, it's possible that the imports are present at the top of the module. But in the problem, only the function code is shown, not the full module. Therefore, in the corrected code, the user may need to include imports for modules they are using.\\n\\nBut perhaps in this context, to write the corrected code correctly, I should include any new imports required. For example, the original uses os and logger. The fixes require subprocess and shlex. So, in the fixed function code, are these imports needed to be inside the function? No. They should be at the top of the module. But since the user is only showing the function, maybe adding the necessary imports inside but that's incorrect.\\n\\nWait, but imports cannot be inside the function. Or can they? Functionally, you can import inside a function, but it's not recommended. But for the code to work correctly, 'import subprocess' and 'import shlex' should be at the top of the module.\\n\\nHowever, given that the original code may already have these imports, it's possible that the function is within a module that already imports the required modules. But since we only need to present the fixed code, perhaps assume that subprocess and shlex are not imported, and therefore need to add them. But in practice, the function isn't responsible for importing modules. So maybe the original code's imports include os and a logger (maybe imported from logging), but not subprocess or shlex. So in the fixed code, the user needs to add:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\nimport shlex\\n\\nBut how? They're part of the standard library, so no problem.\\n\\nSo, the fixed code would now have:\\n\\ndef markdown_to_pdf(md_file_path: str, pdf_file_path: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Converts a markdown file to a PDF using pandoc.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Converting markdown file to PDF...\\\")\\n    if not os.path.exists(md_file_path):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Markdown file not found: %s\\\", md_file_path)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"Markdown file not found: {md_file_path}\\\")\\n    if not md_file_path.endswith('.md'):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Invalid file type: %s\\\", md_file_path)\\n        return\\n    command_list = ['pandoc', md_file_path, '-o', pdf_file_path]\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", ' '.join(shlex.quote(arg) for arg in command_list))\\n    result = subprocess.run(command_list, check=False)\\n    exit_code = result.returncode\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Markdown converted to PDF successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to convert markdown to PDF; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n\\nThis code does not use a shell, hence avoiding the command injection vulnerability.\\n\\nWait, but why use shlex.quote here for logging? Because by joining with ' ' and quoting, it gives a command string that is safe if pasted into a shell. The logging is for the user to see the command being run. But since using a list with subprocess.run bypasses the shell, the actual command is passed as a list of arguments to pandoc, so any special characters in the file paths are handled correctly.\\n\\nSo the logging line would show the command as if it were properly escaped for a shell. So, for example, if md_file_path is \\\"file name.md\\\", the command_str would be 'pandoc file\\\\ name.md -o output.pdf' (depending on how shlex.quote handles it), making the logged command accurate. That's better for transparency.\\n\\nOther points: the original code returns if the file extension is not .md. However, that may not be necessary; but the code's logic is preserved here.\\n\\nSo the corrected code removes the shell use by building a command list and running it via subprocess.run, thus fixing the security issue.\\n\\nHence, the final code would involve:\\n\\n- Building the command as a list.\\n\\n- Using subprocess.run with shell=False (default).\\n\\n- Logging the command with proper shell-escaping using shlex.quote.\\n\\nThe answer code thus should replace the os.system line with subprocess.run and the command list.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":475,\"completion_tokens\":3743,\"total_tokens\":4218},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit report says using eval is insecure because it can execute arbitrary code. The user wants a function that safely evaluates only simple arithmetic and string operations.\\n\\nSo, using ast.literal_eval is safer because it only parses literals, but wait, that can't evaluate expressions like arithmetic. Oh, right, ast.literal_eval is for literals like numbers, strings, lists, etc. Not for expressions like 2+3 or \\\"a\\\"+\\\"b\\\". So I need another way.\\n\\nAlternative approach: Parse the input and check if it's a valid arithmetic or string operation, then evaluate it safely. Maybe using a restricted evaluator.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a whitelist of allowed operations. Like, parse the AST of the script_str and check all nodes are allowed (like BinOp with certain operators, etc.). That's more complex but safer.\\n\\nBut building an AST walker might be time-consuming. Let's see. The function should evaluate simple arithmetic and string operations. So maybe using the ast module to parse the expression into an Abstract Syntax Tree, then validate that all nodes are within allowed types.\\n\\nFor example, allow only constants, and binary operations with operators like Add, Sub, Mult, Div, etc. And for strings, allow concatenation.\\n\\nSo steps:\\n\\n1. Parse the script_str into an AST node. But since it's an expression, maybe wrap it in a lambda to check. Wait, how to parse a single expression?\\n\\nUse ast.parse() with mode='eval' to parse an expression.\\n\\nSomething like:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef parse_user_script(script_str: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        tree = ast.parse(script_str, mode='eval')\\n        # Now walk through the tree and check if all operations are allowed\\n        for node in ast.walk(tree):\\n            if isinstance(node, (ast.Call, ast.Attribute, ast.Subscript, ast.ListComp, ast.Import, ast.ImportFrom)):\\n                # Disallow function calls, method access, etc.\\n                raise ValueError(\\\"Disallowed node type\\\")\\n            if isinstance(node, ast.BinOp):\\n                if not isinstance(node.op, (ast.Add, ast.Sub, ast.Mult, ast.Div, ast.Mod, ast.FloorDiv)):\\n                    # Allow certain operators\\n                    raise ValueError(\\\"Disallowed operator\\\")\\n            # Also check for other allowed node types, like Constants, etc.\\n        # If validation passes, evaluate\\n        compiled = compile(tree, filename='\\u003cstring\\u003e', mode='eval')\\n        result = eval(compiled)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Execution Blocked!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, but even that might not be enough. For example, allowing certain operations but still having potential issues. Like in strings, maybe using formats, but that's a call.\\n\\nBut the original code's purpose was to evaluate arithmetic and string ops. Wait, strings: like \\\"a\\\" + \\\"b\\\" would be allowed. So adding this in the allowed checks.\\n\\nBut what about attribute access? Disallow them by checking if any node is a Attribute, and raise an error.\\n\\nAlso, need to handle situations like accessing constants, allowing numbers and strings as literals.\\n\\nBut maybe this approach is better than using literal_eval, as that only parses literals, and cannot do arithmetic. So by using AST validation, we can create a safe evaluator.\\n\\nSo the code would parse the input into an AST (using 'eval' mode, since it's a single expression), then recursively check each node in the tree. If any disallowed nodes are found (like function calls, imports, etc.), it rejects. Otherwise, compiles and evaluates.\\n\\nThis should mitigate the code injection issue.\\n\\nIn the function, therefore, the steps would be:\\n\\n1. Import ast.\\n\\n2. Parse the input script_str into an AST with mode 'eval' (since it's an expression).\\n\\n3.

If all checks pass, evaluate the expression and return; else, caught in except block and return blocked.\\n\\nSo implementing this would make sure only arithmetic and safe string operations are allowed.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code would involve using ast module to parse, validate the AST nodes, then evaluate if valid.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":307,\"completion_tokens\":1117,\"total_tokens\":1424},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The goal is to allow running code snippets safely.\\n\\nFirst, exec can execute arbitrary code, which is dangerous. To make it safer, I should restrict the environment in which the code runs. Maybe use a restricted namespace with limited globals.\\n\\nI can create a dictionary for the globals that only includes allowed built-in functions. Remove access to dangerous modules like os or sys. Override __import__ to prevent importing modules.\\n\\nAlso, avoid giving access to __builtins__ by default. Instead, explicitly allow certain safe built-in functions. That way, even if someone tries to execute malicious code, they can't access harmful functions.\\n\\nSo, in the exec function, pass the restricted globals dict. The code can only use the functions I allow. Return the result from the restricted environment to maintain functionality but in a controlled way.\\n\\nTesting this approach: if the user's code tries to import or access unsafe modules, it should throw an error. Safe code like math operations should work if permitted.\\n\\nWait, what about the original function didn't return anything. Maybe after fixing, it should return the result, but the problem says the function should return None as per the original code. But perhaps the user expects some output. However, the original code returns None, so maybe keep that but still execute safely.\\n\\nSo, adjust the code to use a sandboxed environment. The key is to limit what the executed code can do. Override __builtins__ to None or a controlled set. Include minimal safe functions.\\n\\nSo here's the step-by-step fix:\\n\\n1. Create a restricted global dictionary that blocks unsafe functions.\\n2. Replace the __builtins__ with a empty dict or only specific safe builtins.\\n3. Use exec within that environment.\\n4.

The secrets module has functions like token_bytes and token_hex, but in this case, the function is using letters, digits, and punctuation. So maybe we can generate each character by choosing securely from the allowed set.\\n\\nThe original code uses random.choices with k=key_size. But secrets doesn't have a choices function that takes k. So I need to loop key_size times and pick a random character each time using secrets.choice. That makes sense. Secrets.choice is cryptographically safe.\\n\\nSo the plan is: import secrets instead of random. Then build the token by selecting each character with secrets.choice from the characters string. Also, make sure to import the string module since the original code uses string.ascii_letters etc.\\n\\nLet me check the original code. Oh, the code has 'import random' inside the function. That's not a problem, but maybe move the import statements outside for better practice, but the main thing is to replace random with secrets. Also, wait, in the original code, string is used but it's imported if the random module is imported? No. The string module is probably not imported, but the code uses string.ascii_letters etc. So the fixed code should have 'import string' at some point.\\n\\nWait, in the original code, there's a line 'import random' inside the function. But string is used before that. So the original code might be missing the import statement for string. Oh, looking back:\\n\\nThe code has:\\n\\ndef generate_security_token(...):\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n\\nWait, there's no import for string here. That would cause a NameError. Hmm, so maybe the original code wasn't shown in full? Because that code would throw an error when string is used. So maybe the actual code includes an import string somewhere. But according to the code shown, there's an error. So the corrected code should also have import string.\\n\\nAssuming that the user's code correctly has the necessary imports, but in the snippet provided, the string module is not imported. So maybe it's a typo in the problem statement, but the corrections should include the necessary imports.\\n\\nIn any case, to make the function work, we need to import both secrets and string. Because the original code uses string.ascii_letters, digits, punctuation.\\n\\nSo the corrected function should have:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\nThen, inside the function:\\n\\ncharacters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n\\nThen generate each character by secrets.choice(characters) for each in range(key_size).\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\ndef generate_security_token(key_size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import string\\n    import secrets\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(key_size))\\n\\nWait, but importing modules inside a function might be a code style issue, but that's how the original code was written. The original code has 'import random' inside the function. So the answer should mirror that structure. Alternatively, move the imports outside. But to avoid potential issues in the function's scope, perhaps the fixed code should have the necessary imports inside the function.\\n\\nWait, the original code had 'import random' inside the function. The problem is that using the \\\"string\\\" module, which was not imported. So there must be an import statement for string either inside or outside the function.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code needs to import string. Since the original code doesn't import string outside the function, maybe the original has an error. But given the code provided, the corrected code must fix that as well. Because as presented, it's using 'string' without importing it, which would result in a NameError.\\n\\nSo, to correct the NameError (in addition to the security issue), the code should import the string module. Therefore, the corrected code should have 'import string' inside or outside the function. Looking back at the original code:\\n\\nOriginal code snippet:\\ndef generate_security_token(...):\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + ... \\n\\nHere, 'string' is used but not imported. So this code will fail. So the fix must include adding 'import string' to the code. Either by importing it at the top or inside the function. Since the original code has 'import random' inside the function, perhaps to keep the structure, adding 'import string' there would fix it.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code will have:\\n\\ndef generate_security_token(key_size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import string\\n    import secrets\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(key_size))\\n\\nBut wait, no; the original code didn't have 'import string' inside. So that's probably another error. So when the user provided the code snippet, maybe they made a mistake. But as per the code provided, the original code omitted the 'import string', but the function will fail when run. However, when the user provided the code, perhaps the 'import string' is somewhere else. But according to the code provided, the function wouldn't work. However, the fix needs to resolve both issues: missing import of string and use of insecure random module.\\n\\nBut the main issue reported by Bandit is using random.choices. So the main correction is replacing the random module with secrets.\\n\\nBut assuming that the original code did have 'import string' in the actual code (even if the user's code snippet may be incomplete), but the critical issue is moving from random to secrets.\\n\\nSo, in the solution, within the function, import string and secrets (replacing random with secrets), and then use secrets.choice for each character.\\n\\nThus, the corrected code would be:\\n\\ndef generate_security_token(key_size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import string\\n    import secrets\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(key_size))\\n\\nThat way, the code uses a secure random generator (secrets) and properly imports the string module.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":342,\"completion_tokens\":1463,\"total_tokens\":1805},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The problem is that the current code uses eval, which is insecure because it can execute arbitrary code. The Bandit report suggests using ast.literal_eval instead, but wait — literal_eval is for parsing literals like strings, numbers, tuples, etc., not expressions. Oh right, because the original function is supposed to process arithmetic expressions. So literal_eval won't evaluate expressions like '2+3*4'. That won't work.\\n\\nHmm, so the user needs to evaluate basic math expressions but safely. Using eval directly is dangerous because someone could input a string like \\\"__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')\\\", which would be a disaster. That's a security risk, especially if the input comes from untrusted users.\\n\\nSo how can I evaluate the input safely? Maybe parse the expression and only allow certain operations. Or use a restricted environment for eval. Like, overriding the __builtins__ to nothing and only allowing certain operations.\\n\\nWait, Python's eval function allows a second parameter for globals and a third for locals. So perhaps I can create a dictionary that limits the allowed names. For arithmetic, maybe only allow numbers and basic operators. But operators aren't functions, so they are part of the syntax.\\n\\nAlternatively, check that the input string contains only allowed characters. Like digits, operators (+, -, *, /), parentheses, and spaces. If any other characters are present, reject the input.\\n\\nSo the plan is: first validate that the ex_string contains only the allowed characters (numbers, operators, parentheses, maybe . for decimals). Then, if it passes the check, evaluate it safely. Otherwise, return an error.\\n\\nSo steps:\\n\\n1. Validate the input against a regex that allows only 0-9, +, -, *, /, ., whitespace, and parentheses. And maybe ^ for exponentiation if the user allows that, but probably here it's basic arithmetic, so include common operators. Need to define a regex pattern.\\n\\nBut need to be careful. For example, what about '2**3' (which uses ** for exponent) — but if the original code allows Python syntax, then the user might expect that. However, if the feature is supposed to be basic arithmetic, exponents might not be intended. So the regex needs to consider that.\\n\\nBut the original use case says \\\"basic arithmetic expressions\\\", so maybe the operators are +, -, *, /, (), and maybe ^ for exponentiation. Or perhaps they want what Python considers as standard.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the function is supposed to interpret expressions using Python syntax (as per the comment), then changing eval's behavior would change that. But since security is the concern, maybe restrict the allowed characters.\\n\\nSo the regex can be something like r'^[\\\\d+\\\\-*/(). ]+$'. Wait, but need to include special characters correctly. Maybe: ^[0-9+\\\\-*/().\\\\s]+$ to match numbers, those operators, parentheses, dots (for decimals), and whitespace. Also, make sure that there's no other characters.\\n\\nBut using a regex can be tricky. For example, invalid expressions could still pass the regex but the eval would fail. But safety is the key here — prevent code execution.\\n\\nAnother approach: create a whitelist of allowed characters. Let's see. Allowing digits 0-9, +, -, *, /, %, ., parentheses (), spaces. Also, maybe ^ for exponent if needed. Alternatively, check that the input does not contain any letters or other characters.\\n\\nThe regex pattern would be:\\n\\n^[\\\\d+\\\\-*/%^.()\\\\s]*$\\n\\nWait, but the hyphen needs to be escaped properly. Inside a character class, placing it at the start or end or escaping it.\\n\\nSo maybe something like r'^[\\\\d\\\\s+\\\\-/*^%().]*$'. But this could allow multiple operators which may not form a valid expression, but the eval would catch syntax errors. The primary goal is to prevent execution of arbitrary code by disallowing any characters that could be part of function calls or variable names.\\n\\nAdditionally, we can restrict the builtins and globals when using eval. So, during evaluation, the global and local namespace is empty, preventing access to any functions or variables.\\n\\nSo combining input validation and a safe eval environment.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\nIn the fixed code:\\n\\n- Use a regex to check the input string only contains allowed characters.\\n\\n- If invalid characters are present, return a computation error.\\n\\n- Otherwise, evaluate within a restricted environment.\\n\\nFor the eval:\\n\\nUse globals and locals that are empty, so that no built-in functions or modules are accessible.\\n\\nSo for the eval call, pass a dictionary {'__builtins__': None} as globals, and locals also as None or empty.\\n\\nThus:\\n\\nresult = eval(ex_string, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n\\nBut wait, this restricts access to built-ins, but arithmetic operations would still be allowed. However, even with that, some forms of code could be executed. Let me check. For example, if the input is \\\" (1).__class__ \\\", would that work?\\n\\nBut if we restrict builtins and namespaces, even then certain operations might not be safe. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, in the restricted environment, there's no __builtins__, so accessing any methods would raise an error. For example, '2 + 3' is okay, but 'abs(-5)' would not be, since abs is part of builtins.\\n\\nBut the regex that we added earlier (only numbers and operators, no letters, etc.) would already block any function names, variables, or other problematic constructs. So combining regex and restricted environment would be more secure.\\n\\nSo the steps are:\\n\\n1. Check if the input string matches the allowed pattern (only digits, basic operators, parentheses, etc.).\\n\\n2. If it doesn't, return computation error.\\n\\n3. If it does, then evaluate in a restricted environment without builtins.\\n\\nNow, how to implement this.\\n\\nFirst, import re and ast? Well, no, in the original code, the function uses eval. So:\\n\\nFirst, add the regex check.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nimport re\\n\\ndef calculate_expression(ex_string: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Check if the ex_string contains only allowed characters\\n    allowed_chars = r'^[\\\\d\\\\s+\\\\-*/%().^]*$'\\n    if not re.match(allowed_chars, ex_string):\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    try:\\n        # Use a restricted environment\\n        result = eval(ex_string, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, but what about possible syntax errors? For example, if the input is \\\"2 + * 3\\\", the regex passes but eval will throw an error. That's okay; the except clause will catch it and return the error.\\n\\nBut how about letters in other forms or unicode characters? The regex here is using \\\\d which is [0-9], and the allowed_chars regex does not include letters. So any letters would cause the regex to fail, thus blocking.\\n\\nBut need to be careful about other characters. For example, if the user inputs \\\"1e3\\\", the 'e' is part of exponent notation (like 1e3 = 1000). The regex as written (with \\\\d) would not allow the 'e'. So this would be a problem. Because in that case, scientific notation would be blocked.\\n\\nBut the problem description says \\\"basic arithmetic expressions\\\". If the original code handles scientific notation, then this would be a breaking change. So the user might expect a scientific notation input to be allowed.\\n\\nHmmm. So perhaps the regex is too restrictive.\\n\\nAlternatively, the original code uses Python's eval, which includes scientific notation. So if the user intends to support that, but the regex blocks 'e', then it's a problem.\\n\\nSo perhaps not possible to cover all cases with a simple regex.\\n\\nIn that case, the regex approach might not be feasible. Alternatively, the allowed patterns would permit 'e' for exponents. So modify the regex.\\n\\nLet's adjust the regex to allow 'e' and '.' for floating points.\\n\\nAllowed chars could be: r'^[0-9eE+\\\\-*/%().^ \\\\t]*$'\\n\\nBut adding e and E. Then check if that covers scientific notation. So \\\"2e3\\\" would be okay.\\n\\nBut wait, but using 'e' could also be part of a variable name. Like 'ex', but because our regex is blocking other letters and the first thing we check the pattern, 'ex' would be rejected since other letters are not allowed, but if the input is '1e3', the regex allows it. So yes, 'e' in that context is allowed.\\n\\nSo, modifying the allowed_chars to include e and E for exponents.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nallowed_chars = r'^[0-9eE+\\\\-*/%().^ \\\\t]*$'\\n\\nBut then the problem is: could this allow other constructs? Like '1e1000', which is a valid number.\\n\\nBut the key is to not allow any letters except e and E in their correct positions. But regex can't check that e is used correctly; it just checks that the entire string is made up of these characters. So an invalid expression like '123e+4.5' would pass the regex but raise an error in eval.\\n\\nBut that's handled by the try/except block.\\n\\nSo this approach may be acceptable.\\n\\nPutting all together:\\n\\nThe fixed code would first check against a regex that allows numbers, basic arithmetic operators, parentheses, and scientific notation (e/E). If the input matches, then proceed to evaluate in a secure environment where built-in functions and variables are not accessible.\\n\\nAnother potential vulnerability: in Python, even with builtins restricted, you can do things like accessing ().__class__ which might be a way to get back to object hierarchies, but maybe in this case, since the input can only contain certain characters, perhaps it's blocked.\\n\\nWait, if the input string is '().__class__', but according to the allowed regex, is that acceptable? Let's see: the allowed pattern allows dots. So yes, if the input contains '().__class__', but in the allowed_chars regex.\\n\\nWait, original regex allows periods and other characters. So '().__class__' would consist of characters: ( ) . _ and letters. But the allowed regex only includes 0-9eE+\\\\-*/%().^ and spaces/tabs. So underscores and letters like 'c', 'l', etc., are not allowed. Unless I missed something.\\n\\nAh the allowed characters are:\\n\\nr'^[0-9eE+\\\\-*/%().^ \\\\t]*$'.\\n\\nSo in that case, any letters other than e or E would not be allowed. So strings with 'class', '__', etc., are not allowed because they contain characters like 'c', 's', etc., which are not in the regex.\\n\\nWait, oops: yes. The regex includes 0-9, e, E, +, -,*, /, %, (, ), ., ^, whitespaces, and tabs. Letters like 'c' 'l' 'a' and underscores are not allowed. So an input like '().__class__' has 'self dot __class__' would include underscores and letters, so the regex check would reject them, even if that was possible via the allowed operators.\\n\\nThus, the regex blocks any letters except e/E.\\n\\nTherefore, combining the regex check and the restricted environment in eval is safer.\\n\\nSo the steps:\\n\\n- Check input against the regex allowing only 0-9, e, E, operators, parentheses, etc.\\n\\nIf not pass, return error.\\n\\nOtherwise, evaluate in a namespace with no built-ins and no locals.\\n\\nThus, if a malicious user tries to input something like '1 + __import__(\\\"os\\\").system(\\\"ls\\\")', it would be blocked by the regex because it contains letters and underscores which are not allowed.\\n\\nThus, overall, the code becomes more secure.\\n\\nNow, implement this in code:\\n\\nFirst, import re.\\n\\nHandle the regex check. If regex passes, proceed, else return error.\\n\\nThen, eval with restricted globals and locals.\\n\\nAlso, some possible edge cases:\\n\\n- The input could be an empty string. Regex allows zero or more of the allowed characters, so empty string is allowed, but eval would throw a syntax error. So into the except block.\\n\\nSimilarly, valid expressions like '2 + 3' would pass.\\n\\nSo, the corrected code would be as follows:\\n\\nLet me write the code.\\n\\nFirst, in the calculate_expression function.\\n\\nImport re at the top.\\n\\nBut the original code didn't have any imports. Oh, because the original code uses eval, and the function's code. The user may have already imported re elsewhere, but likely here to insert the required imports.\\n\\nSo adding:\\n\\nimport re\\n\\nThen:\\n\\ndef calculate_expression(ex_string: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Check for allowed characters: digits, e/E, operators, parentheses, etc.\\n    if not re.fullmatch(r'^[0-9eE+\\\\-*/().%^ \\\\t]*$', ex_string):\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    try:\\n        # Use a restricted environment\\n        result = eval(ex_string, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, note that in regex, fullmatch is better than match because match may partially match, but perhaps in the original code, it used re.match which checks from the start but allows any ending if the pattern isn't properly anchored.\\n\\nOur regex already uses ^ and $, so re.fullmatch() is redundant; re.match() would suffice as the pattern starts with ^ and ends with $.\\n\\nBut I can write it as re.fullmatch.\\n\\nIn any case, the regex is anchored.\\n\\nSo, this combines input validation and a restricted eval environment.\\n\\nBut what about edge cases where the regex passes but the eval is dangerous. For example, the input is something like ' (1).__class__ ', but the regex allows this? Wait, (1).__class__ contains underscores and 'class', but the letters 'c', 'l', etc., which are not in the regex. The regex would not allow underscores ('_')! Wait, the regex allows [0-9eE+\\\\-*/%().^ \\\\t]. Underscore is not allowed. So ' (1).__class__ ' includes '_' and 'cls...' letters, which are not in the allowed characters and hence the regex blocks it.\\n\\nThus, this code should be secure.\\n\\nTesting with sample input.\\n\\nSample input: '2+3*4' → allowed. Evaluates to 14.\\n\\nSample input: '__import__(\\\"os\\\").system(\\\"rm -rf /\\\")' → has letters and underscores and quotes. Regex blocks it.\\n\\nInput: '0xdeadbeef' → 'x' and letters are not allowed. So the regex blocks.\\n\\nInput using powers: '2**3' → in the regex, ** would be allowed (since '*' is allowed). So eval('2**3') would compute 8. The regex allows '*' and which appears in the allowed set.\\n\\nWait, the regex allows '*', so yes. So the code would process exponents via **.\\n\\nBut in the regex, the ^ character is also allowed; in Python, the exponentiation operator is **, but the ^ is bitwise XOR. So if the regex allows ^ but it's used, for example, in '2 ^ 3', which is erroneous (in Python, ^ is XOR, not power). However, if the original code uses Python syntax, then users need to use ** for exponents.\\n\\nHowever, the allowed_chars includes ^ but in Python it's XOR. If the application allows that, then it's acceptable. However, if the application intended for ^ to signify exponent (like some calculators), then they are not handled correctly. So this may be a separate issue. But according to the original code, the function is supposed to interpret expressions using Python syntax. Therefore, ^ being allowed is acceptable, and in the case of someone using it (like 2^3 will give 1 in Python, but differently from if they used 2**3). But if the user is supposed to allow Python syntax, perhaps the regex shouldn't restrict this character. Therefore, including ^ in the regex and allowing it hence.\\n\\nSo the code seems correct.\\n\\nAnother example input: '1 + (2 * 3) - 4.e5'. All allowed characters: passes regex. Eval to 1 +6 -400000 → which eval('1 + (2 *3)-4.e5')= -39993. So this would work.\\n\\nThus, these steps fix the vulnerabilities by restricting input to only safe characters and using a restricted eval environment.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code is as follows, incorporating both regex-based input validation and a safe evaluation context.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":295,\"completion_tokens\":3646,\"total_tokens\":3941},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit report says to use ast.literal_eval instead. But wait, ast.literal_eval only works with literals like numbers, tuples, lists, etc. It can't evaluate expressions with operators or functions. So if the user submits something like \\\"2 + 3\\\", literal_eval would throw an error because that's not a literal. Hmmm.\\n\\nThe function's purpose is to evaluate mathematical expressions, so maybe I need a safer way than eval. Oh right, using eval with user input is dangerous because it can execute arbitrary code.\\n\\nSo alternative approaches: parse the expression manually. But that's complicated. Another idea: sanitize the input, allowing only certain characters like digits, operators, parentheses. Maybe use a regex to check that the input only contains allowed characters before evaluating.\\n\\nThen I can build a safe environment for eval. For example, use a dictionary to restrict the built-in functions and variables available during evaluation. But how?\\n\\nWait, maybe the simplest way is to validate the input string to ensure it only contains mathematical operators and numbers. Like, check that the math_expression only has 0-9, +, -, *, /, ., (, ), space, maybe ** for exponent, etc. Any other characters are disallowed.\\n\\nSo steps:\\n\\n1. Use a regex to validate the math_expression. Allow digits, basic operators, parentheses, decimal points, and whitespace.\\n\\n2. If the expression passes the regex check, then use eval in a restricted environment that doesn't have access to unsafe functions.\\n\\nWait, but how to create a safe environment for eval. Like, maybe override the __builtins__ to be None, and only allow certain operations.\\n\\nAlternatively, for a mathematical expression evaluator, maybe the user isn't supposed to use any functions, just basic math. So I can use a custom globals dict that limits what's accessible.\\n\\nSo, here's the plan. First, create a regex pattern that matches valid mathematical expressions. The pattern should reject any characters that are not numbers, operators, or parentheses. Let's think about valid characters: 0-9, +, -, *, /, %, ., ^, spaces, maybe ** for exponentiation in Python. Also parentheses.\\n\\nThe regex could be something like r'^[\\\\d+\\\\-*/().%^ ]+$' but need to make sure order of operations and validity isn't checked here, just the allowed characters. But have to be careful with allowing hyphens (could be negative numbers), so maybe allowing them but with some constraints.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a more precise regex. Anyway, after validating, then evaluate with a minimal environment.\\n\\nAnother thing is names: the regex should not allow any letters, so variables like 'a' or function names like 'os' can't be used. That would make sense. Because if someone inputs 'os.system(...)' that would be dangerous. So by only allowing digits, operators, parentheses, and decimal points, we can prevent variable or function names from being included.\\n\\nSo first, the regex pattern. Let me test some cases:\\n\\nValid inputs: \\\"2 + 3\\\", \\\"3*(5 - 2)\\\", \\\"5.6 / 2.3\\\", \\\"-4.2\\\", \\\" (3 + 2)*5 \\\", \\\"2**3\\\".\\n\\nBut in the regex pattern, allowed characters would be numbers, +, -, *, /, . , (), %, ^ (but ^ is xor in Python, maybe better to replace with ** for exponent). So maybe using a regex that allows [0-9], +, -, *, /, ., %, parentheses, and spaces.\\n\\nBut if exponentiation is allowed, maybe check for ** as an operator.\\n\\nHmm, maybe the regex can be:\\n\\n^[\\\\s\\\\d+\\\\-*/().%]+$\\n\\nWait, but this might allow combinations that aren't safe. For example, if someone uses __import__('os')... but if the regex doesn't allow letters, then such input is blocked.\\n\\nSo the regex should match the entire input string, ensuring that it only contains digits, whitespace, and the operators +, -, *, /, . , %, and parentheses.\\n\\nSo the regex pattern would be:\\n\\n^[\\\\d\\\\+\\\\-\\\\*/\\\\^\\\\%\\\\(\\\\)\\\\.\\\\s]+$\\n\\nWait, but ^ is allowed here. But maybe in the regex we can include ** for exponents. Hmm, but how to represent that in a regex. Wait the regex checks each character, so ** would have two * characters. But if the regex allows *, the two *s are okay.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex is not enough. It needs to filter out any characters that are not permitted. So letters must not be allowed. So the regex would be:\\n\\n^[0-9+\\\\-*/().%^ ]+$\\n\\nThe caret (^) in the regex here is the start of the string, not the actual ^ character. Wait, no: in the character class, it's included. So in the regex pattern:\\n\\nr'^[\\\\d+\\\\-*/().%^ ]+$'\\n\\nWait, let me break it down. The [ ] includes:\\n\\n\\\\d: digits,\\n\\n+, -, *, /, (, ), ., %, ^, space.\\n\\nSo any of these characters allowed. The ^ is placed at the end to avoid being mistaken for a negation.\\n\\nThe regex is case-sensitive, so any letters in the input would be rejected.\\n\\nThis way, if the user tries to input something like __import__('os'), those underscores and letters would be rejected.\\n\\nSo passing this regex check is the first step.\\n\\nIf the input string passes, then evaluate the expression using a restricted environment. For example, pass a dictionary to eval that restricts the built-in functions. Or use an empty __builtins__.\\n\\nSo when evaluating, the eval function should not have access to any global or local variables except those we explicitly allow.\\n\\nLike, construct a dictionary for the global namespace that is empty, except perhaps for functions that are safe. Or in this case, if it's mathematical expressions, there shouldn't be any variables involved. Unless the user is allowed to have variables like in expressions... but according to the problem, the user submits a mathematical expression. So the intended functionality is to calculate the value of a numerical expression.\\n\\nTherefore, the safe code would be:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef evaluate_user_math(math_expression: str):\\n    allowed_chars = set('0123456789+-*/().%^ ')\\n    if not all(c in allowed_chars for c in math_expression):\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid characters in expression\\\")\\n    # Allow exponentiation (using **)\\n    # Replace ^ with ** if user uses that\\n    math_expression = math_expression.replace('^', '**')\\n    try:\\n        # Use ast.literal_eval for safety, but wait, can it evaluate expressions?\\n        # No, ast.literal_eval can't evaluate expressions with operators.\\n        # Hmm, that's a problem. So then, after validation, maybe use eval with no builtins?\\n        # To prevent access to any functions or variables.\\n        # So create a restricted namespace.\\n        return eval(math_expression, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid mathematical expression\\\")\\n\\nBut wait, using eval with {'__builtins__': None} would disable access to built-in functions, which makes it safer. But can mathematical operations still be evaluated?\\n\\nFor example, would 2 + 3 evaluate to 5? Let's see, in Python, the + operator works even in an environment without builtins. So math operations that use operators, like 2+3, (5-4)*2, etc., can still be evaluated even if builtins are not available.\\n\\nThis way, expressions containing only numbers and operators can be safely evaluated.\\n\\nBut I need to test edge cases. Like, what if someone inputs something like \\\" (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) \\\" ? That should work.\\n\\nAnother example: \\\"pow(2,3)\\\" would not work because the builtin functions are not available. But '2**3' would work.\\n\\nWait, so in this approach, the function can evaluate mathematical expressions that use operators (+, -, *, /, **, etc.), but any function calls like abs(-5) or pow(2,3) would fail because those functions are not available in the restricted environment.\\n\\nThus, only operator-based expressions are allowed. But if the user intends to call math functions, this approach would block that. But since the problem says 'evaluate a given mathematical expression', perhaps that is acceptable.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider: division, integer vs floating-point.\\n\\nSo the regex replacement idea was to allow ^ as **. So if the user inputs \\\"2 ^ 3\\\", it's replaced with \\\"2**3\\\". Which might accommodate users coming from other languages where ^ is exponent.\\n\\nBut in the regex allowed characters, I allowed ^. So perhaps that substitution is necessary.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the function would:\\n\\n1. Check that all characters in the input are in allowed list (digits, +, -, *, /, (, ), ., %, ^, space)\\n2. Replace ^ with ** for exponentiation.\\n3. Evaluate the expression in a safe environment with no access to builtins or other functions.\\n\\nThis restricts the code to pure mathematical expressions using operators.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would look like:\\n\\nimport re\\n\\ndef evaluate_user_math(math_expression: str):\\n    # Use regex to check for allowed characters\\n    if not re.match(r'^[\\\\d+\\\\-*/()%.^ ]+$', math_expression):\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid characters in the expression\\\")\\n    # Replace ^ with ** for exponentiation\\n    expr = math_expression.replace('^', '**')\\n    try:\\n        return eval(expr, {\\\"__builtins__\\\": None}, {})\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid mathematical expression\\\") from e\\n\\nBut wait, the regex uses \\\\d which includes 0-9, and the allowed characters are: +, -, *, /, (, ), %, ., ^, space. Plus any digits.\\n\\nSo this regex checks if the entire string consists only of those characters. Additionally, using ^ and $ ensures that the entire string must match.\\n\\nThis would disallow any letters or other characters, ensuring that functions like __import__ are blocked.\\n\\nEval in this restricted namespace (no built-ins) should prevent execution of any dangerous code. But operator-based expressions are still allowed.\\n\\nTesting this approach:\\n\\nevaluate_user_math(\\\"2 + 3\\\") → returns 5.\\n\\nevaluate_user_math(\\\"2 * (3.5 + 4.7)\\\") → returns 16.4.\\n\\nevaluate_user_math(\\\"__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')\\\") → regex will disallow because of letters and underscores.\\n\\nAnother test: input is \\\"os.system('dir')\\\", the regex will have letters, so it's rejected.\\n\\nFor expressions like \\\"1 + 2%3\\\", allowed. The % is modulo.\\n\\nIf a user tries to input \\\"2 ** 3\\\" which uses **, allowed. If they use \\\"^\\\", replaced with **.\\n\\nSo, this should cover the safe evaluation.\\n\\nHence, this approach fixes the vulnerability.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":271,\"completion_tokens\":2526,\"total_tokens\":2797},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The problem is that the code uses a weak pseudo-random number generator, specifically the random module, which isn't secure for cryptographic purposes.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that for security-sensitive tasks like generating authentication tokens, the random module isn't suitable. Instead, the secrets module should be used because it generates cryptographically strong random numbers. So the main step is probably replacing random.choices with something from secrets.\\n\\nThe original code uses random.choices, which selects elements from the characters string with possible repeats. The equivalent in secrets would be to use secrets.choice in a loop. Because secrets doesn't have a choices function like random does, but we can build the token by repeatedly selecting a random character from the allowed set using secrets.choice.\\n\\nAlso, I should make sure to import the secrets module. Since the original code imports random within the function, I'll adjust that to import secrets instead. Wait, but importing inside the function isn't a good practice, but maybe the original code did that for some reason. Alternatively, perhaps the code had other imports. Wait, looking at the original code, there's a line 'import random' inside the function. The code also uses string.ascii_letters etc., which means the string module is imported, but in the original code, is the string module imported? Wait, looking back: the vulnerable code has 'characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation', but there's no import statement for string in the code. Oh, wait, that's an error. The original code probably has an import string that's missing. Because using string.ascii_letters without importing string would cause a NameError. Wait, let me check again:\\n\\nOriginal code:\\ndef generate_auth_token(token_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Using weak pseudo-random number generator (vulnerable code)\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=token_length))\\n\\nAh, I see. The function uses 'string.ascii_letters' but there's no 'import string' in the code. So that's another bug. Wait, but when generating the code, perhaps the user made a mistake, and in reality, the code does have an import string. But in the given code snippet, the function imports random but not string. So that code as is would actually throw an error when run. Hmm, maybe that's a different issue. So perhaps the user intended to have the string module imported, so in the fixed code I need to add import string at the top.\\n\\nWait, okay, the original code as given would have a NameError because 'string' is not imported. So the initial code has a bug. Because they use string.ascii_letters etc., which would require an import. So maybe the original code is missing 'import string' but that's perhaps part of the problem. So to fix that, I need to add 'import string' in the function. Or maybe that's a typo in the user's message. Let me proceed assuming that the original code was supposed to have that import.\\n\\nIn any case, in the function as written, after adding 'import string' would be necessary to avoid NameErrors. Wait, no. Let me look again. No, the code in the generate_auth_token function starts with 'import random', then characters = ... uses string.ascii_letters. So the code as given would in fact cause a NameError because string is not imported. So that's an error in the original code. Wait, but maybe the code actually did have an import string at the top. Maybe that's a formatting error here when the code was presented. Let me check the original code again.\\n\\nThe user-provided vulnerable code:\\n\\ndef generate_auth_token(token_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Using weak pseudo-random number generator (vulnerable code)\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=token_length))\\n\\nHere, the characters line uses 'string' module functions but there's no 'import string' inside the function or at the top. Therefore, this code would throw a NameError: name 'string' is not defined. So the original code is incorrect. Therefore, in the corrected code, we need to import the string module, possibly by adding 'import string' somewhere.\\n\\nSo, in addition to replacing the random module with secrets, we must also fix the missing import of the string module.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the corrected code needs to:\\n\\n1. Replace 'random' with 'secrets' to generate secure tokens.\\n2. Fix the missing import of 'string'.\\n3. Generate the characters string correctly.\\n4. Generate the token using a method from 'secrets' instead of 'random.choices'.\\n\\nHow does secrets handle selection? Since secrets.choices() doesn't exist, the usual approach is to use secrets.choice() in a loop for each character. So for each character in the token length, pick a random element from the characters.\\n\\nSo, replacing ''.join(random.choices(...)) with ''.join([secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(token_length)]).\\n\\nAdditionally, the import for 'secrets' would need to be at the top of the function, or imported in the global scope. But generally, it's better to import modules outside the function. However, in the given code, the original code imported 'random' inside the function, which is considered poor practice but allowed. So the corrected code might do the same, importing secrets inside the function.\\n\\nAlternatively, better practice would be to import modules at the top. So perhaps, the corrected code should import string and secrets in the standard way.\\n\\nSo the corrected code might look like:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef generate_auth_token(token_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(token_length))\\n\\nBut in the original code, the 'random' was imported inside the function, perhaps to scope it. But according to the code as provided, the user may expect the fixed code to include all necessary imports, even if in a different structure.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user's code omitted the string import by mistake. In any case, the corrected code needs to have imports for both string and the secure random module (secrets).\\n\\nSo maybe in the fixed version:\\n\\nThe code imports string and uses secrets. So:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef generate_auth_token(token_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(token_length))\\n\\nBut per the original code structure, perhaps only the 'random' was inside the function. But importing inside the function is not a good practice. But to just correct the code, the main issue is replacing the random module. So let's implement that.\\n\\nAlso note that using 'secrets' is the safer choice here.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code will first import string and secrets, perhaps at the top, create the characters, and then use secrets.choice in a list comprehension to build the token.\\n\\nWait, the code in the function 'generate_auth_token' may not have the 'import string', so that's part of the correction here. So in the original code, the string module was not imported. So perhaps adding 'import string' inside the function.\\n\\nBut usually, imports are at the top of the file. However, the code provided had the 'import random' inside the function.\\n\\nHmm. So perhaps the original code had 'import random' inside the function, but the corrected code should replace that with importing secrets. However, the code also uses 'string.ascii_letters', which is part of the string module. Therefore, the original code probably has an import statement missing for the string module. But since this is just the code for the function, perhaps the original code is part of a larger context where the string was imported. However, in the code provided by the user, the string is not imported.\\n\\nSo perhaps in the corrected code, the import of 'secrets' can replace the 'import random', and also import string either inside the function or at the top. Since the original code doesn't import string, that's a bug. So the corrected code would need to import string.\\n\\nTherefore, to fix the code as provided, which doesn't have the import string, which would lead to a NameError, perhaps the fixed code also adds an import for string.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\nThe corrected function will:\\n\\n- Remove the 'import random' line.\\n\\n- Add imports for 'string' and 'secrets' at the top of the function or the module.\\n\\nBut in Python, you can't have global imports when they are inside a function. So the code as provided may be structured as such.\\n\\nWait, looking back, the original code has:\\n\\ndef generate_auth_token(...):\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters... \\n\\nSo the 'string' is not imported, leading to an error. Therefore, the code as provided is incorrect. Therefore, to fix the code, the string module needs to be imported either inside the function or at the top.\\n\\nThus, the corrected code should first import the string module.\\n\\nBut perhaps the code was supposed to have 'import string' inside the function, but then again, in the original code the (probably buggy) code without that, so we need to include that in the correct version.\\n\\nWait, but according to the user's problem, the Bandit analysis pointed out the vulnerability is in line 8 (the random.choices) not in the 'string.ascii_letters' line. So in reality, perhaps the original code does import string elsewhere, but the code snippet provided might be missing that.\\n\\nBut given that the code snippet provided is the entirety of the code, except possibly other code not provided (like import statements), we can only work with what is given.\\n\\nIn this scenario, we need to fix the code snippet provided. Since the provided code snippet uses the string module but does not import it, that must be addressed.\\n\\nSo in the corrected code, first, we need to import the string module. So the corrected function would import both string and secrets.\\n\\nBut here's the user's original code:\\n\\ndef generate_auth_token(...):\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + ... \\n\\nSo, inside the function, we import string as well.\\n\\nBut no, this can't be. Import statements can be placed inside functions. So perhaps the problem is that the code was relying on a global import. But in the code given, there is no import string. Therefore, the function generate_auth_token as written would throw a NameError because 'string' is not defined.\\n\\nSo that's a separate bug in the code that was provided. But the user is asking to fix the vulnerability found by Bandit (use of insecure random).\\n\\nSo perhaps the initial code that was provided also includes an 'import string' line omitted here, but given that the code as written would have a syntax error, perhaps there's a different mistake. Or maybe the user omitted the 'import string' in the code when writing the example.\\n\\nIn any case, to make the code run correctly, we must add the import for the string module. So the corrected code would have:\\n\\nimport string\\n\\nat the top, or inside the function.\\n\\nBut given the problem presented, the vulnerability is in the use of random.choices. So to fix the Bandit issue, we must replace random.choices with a secure alternative.\\n\\nTherefore, the step-by-step correction is:\\n\\n1. Replace the use of the random module with secrets.\\n\\n2. Replace random.choices(characters, k=token_length) with a secure method of generating each character using secrets.\\n\\nThe solution is to generate each character in the token by using secrets.choice(characters) for each of the token_length times.\\n\\nAlso, since the original code uses 'random.choices', which may select the same character multiple times (since it's with replacement), but the same could be done with secrets.\\n\\nNow, making the changes:\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\ndef generate_auth_token(token_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=token_length))\\n\\nCorrected code steps:\\n\\na. Replace import random with import string and import secrets.\\n\\nBut since the problem is in the 'random' module, in the code, import line inside the function is importing random. Instead, the code should use 'secrets', so the corrected function would perhaps import 'secrets' and 'string'.\\n\\nBut since the original code has 'import random' inside the function, which is where the error is accepted.\\n\\nTherefore, to fix the function, first, the code should remove the 'import random' line, ensure that string is imported (perhaps as a global import), and import secrets.\\n\\nBut without the 'string' import, the code won't work.\\n\\nWait, maybe the user forgot to include the 'import string' line in their code, and that's causing a separate error. However, the Bandit report doesn't mention that, which suggests that the user might have had an 'import string' in the rest of their code.\\n\\nBut for the code to be correct, it has to have that.\\n\\nThus, in the corrected code:\\n\\nWe need to have:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef generate_auth_token(token_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(token_length))\\n\\nThis way, the code has all the required imports, and uses secrets instead of random.\\n\\nIn the original code, the function probably either had the string imported elsewhere, or was an omission in the code snippet provided. But in order for the code to be correct, the 'import string' is required, so adding it in the global scope.\\n\\nAlso, the original code didn't have any imports outside the function, but had import random inside. But for both string and secrets, it's better to import them at the top.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code should include 'import string' and 'import secrets' at the top, replace the use of 'random' with 'secrets' in the token generation.\\n\\nSo in the function, the line:\\n\\nreturn ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=token_length))\\n\\nis replaced with:\\n\\nreturn ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(token_length))\\n\\nAnd the line where 'random' was imported is removed, and replaced with the appropriate imports.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code is as follows:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef generate_auth_token(token_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(token_length))\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":345,\"completion_tokens\":3230,\"total_tokens\":3575},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

Bandit flagged this because using the default PRNG isn't secure for cryptographic purposes. \\n\\nThe problem is with using random.choices. The random module is not cryptographically secure. So I should replace it with a module that's designed for security, like secrets.\\n\\nFirst, let's think about changing the import from random to secrets. The secrets module is recommended for generating secure random numbers. So instead of importing random, I should import secrets.\\n\\nThen, replace random.choices with secrets.choice in a loop. Because secrets doesn't have a choices method with a k parameter. Wait, how does choices work? The random.choices function selects multiple elements with replacement. To replicate that with secrets, I probably need to loop password_length times and pick a character each time using secrets.choice from the characters string.\\n\\nWait, let me check: secrets.choice(sequence) returns a randomly chosen element from the sequence. So to generate a password of length password_length, I can do a list comprehension that calls secrets.choice(characters) for each character in the password.\\n\\nSo the corrected line would be something like: ''.join([secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(password_length)]).\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the code imports secrets instead of random, and the other parts stay the same.

So that would cause a NameError when string is used. Because string is a separate module. So that's actually an error in the original code. So the correct code should first fix that.\\n\\nSo to fix that, the corrected code should include 'import string' as well. Hmm, that's an error in the original code that needs fixing.\\n\\nSo first step: Fix the name error by importing the string module.\\n\\nBut in the code given, the user didn't include that. Oh, right, the user's code has:\\n\\nimport random inside the function, but not import string. So 'string' isn't imported anywhere, which will cause an error.\\n\\nSo that's an error in the code.

The problem is that eval can execute arbitrary code, which is unsafe, as mentioned in the Bandit report. The suggestion is to use ast.literal_eval instead, but wait, literal_eval only evaluates literals, like numbers, lists, dictionaries, etc. It might not handle mathematical expressions. So how do I safely evaluate math expressions without allowing code execution?\\n\\nHmm, maybe the right approach is to parse the expression first, ensuring it only contains mathematical operations and valid literals. Like, check if the input expression consists of digits, operators, parentheses, and maybe some allowed functions.\\n\\nWait, the original code uses eval, so perhaps the intended use is for mathematical expressions but the current code is unsafe. To make it safe, maybe I should use a restricted environment for eval, like replacing the builtins with a safe subset.\\n\\nYes, using a custom namespace that limits the allowed functions. For example, allow only mathematical functions from the math module, but none of the dangerous built-in functions or attributes.\\n\\nSo, here's the plan: create a dictionary that maps allowed names to safe functions and constants. Import necessary modules like math, but restrict to specific functions. Also, validate the expression to check for any disallowed characters or patterns before evaluating. Wait, but validation can be tricky because expressions can have variables, but if the variables are from the safe namespace, maybe it's manageable.\\n\\nAlternatively, for this problem, maybe the safest way is to use ast.literal_eval but that won't evaluate expressions with operations. For example, \\\"2+3\\\" is parsed by literal_eval as 5 only if it's a string, but literal_eval won't process that. Oh right, because literal_eval doesn't evaluate expressions, just literals. So that's not going to work.\\n\\nSo eval is necessary here but needs to be sandboxed. So in the code, instead of using the global namespace, provide a restricted environment. For mathematical expressions, allow only certain functions and symbols.\\n\\nWait, the user says the tool is for mathematical expressions. So, we can define a dictionary that includes math functions (like sqrt, sin, etc.) and allow numbers, operators. Then pass that dictionary as the globals parameter to eval, which limits the functions that can be called.\\n\\nFor instance:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {\\n    '__builtins__': None,  # Disable all built-in functions\\n    'math': math,  # Maybe import math and allow certain functions?\\n}\\n\\nBut even better, create a restricted environment. Also, to use math functions, perhaps explicitly import them and add them to the allowed_globals. Like, import math and then in the allowed_globals, include 'sqrt': math.sqrt, 'sin': math.sin, etc. But then the user would have to call them with the math prefix, unless the allowed_globals include the functions directly.\\n\\nAlternatively, set the __builtins__ to None in the locals dict to prevent access to any built-in functions. Then, include specific allowed functions in the globals or locals dict.\\n\\nSo the revised code could be:\\n\\nimport math\\n\\ndef safely_execute_expression(expression_code: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        allowed_globals = {\\n            '__builtins__': None,\\n            'math': math,\\n        }\\n        allowed_locals = {\\n            'sqrt': math.sqrt,\\n            'sin': math.sin,\\n            # include allowed functions here\\n        }\\n        result = eval(expression_code, allowed_globals, allowed_locals)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Unsafe Code Detected!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut wait, the allowed_globals has __builtins__ set to None, which should disable all builtins. The expression can then use math functions if they are imported properly. However, this approach might not handle simple arithmetic because operators like +, -, etc., are not part of the builtins. Wait, builtins are functions like open, __import__, etc. The operators themselves are part of the Python syntax, so eval can still use them unless the expression involves variables that require builtins.\\n\\nWait, this approach can prevent access to dangerous functions, but the math operations (like 2 + 3 * 4) are allowed. The problem with the initial code was that eval was using the default globals, which allowed any built-in functions.\\n\\nSo by restricting the globals to not include builtins, and allowing only certain variables like math or specific functions, the eval becomes safer.\\n\\nBut even then, what if the user passes something like \\\"__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')\\\"? If __builtins__ is None, then trying to access __import__ would raise an error. So setting __builtins__ to None in the globals should prevent access to most dangerous functions.\\n\\nBut there's another issue: what if the expression_code uses a variable name that isn't in the allowed_globals? For example, if someone writes \\\"a + b\\\" and neither a nor b are in allowed_globals or locals, that would raise a NameError. So if the intended use is for the expression to be a mathematical formula using literals (like \\\"2 + 3*5\\\"), then allowing math functions and having no variables would work. But if the user includes variables, the code might fail.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the safest way is to only evaluate literal mathematical expressions, but how to handle that.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the ast module to parse the expression and ensure it doesn't contain any function calls or attribute accesses. But that might be complicated.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a third-party library like asteval, but the user probably wants to avoid external dependencies.\\n\\nAlternative plan: Use the eval with a very restricted namespace. Allow only a few mathematical functions and constants (like pi, e from math). Also, disable builtins.\\n\\nSo here's how:\\n\\n- Remove __builtins__ from the eval environment.\\n- Only include allowed functions and constants from the math module.\\n- Allow basic arithmetic operations.\\n\\nThus, the eval call is made in a restricted environment where only certain math functions are allowed.\\n\\nLet me code that.\\n\\nImport math first.\\n\\nCreate a global_allow dict:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {\\n    '__builtins__': None,\\n    'sqrt': math.sqrt,\\n    'sin': math.sin,\\n    'cos': math.cos,\\n    'tan': math.tan,\\n    'pi': math.pi,\\n    'e': math.e,\\n    # Add more allowed math functions and constants as needed\\n}\\n\\nBut this requires the user to write expressions like sqrt(2) rather than math.sqrt(2). Alternatively, including the math module:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {\\n    '__builtins__': None,\\n    'math': math,\\n}\\n\\nBut then users have to write math.sqrt(2). So in this case, allowing math but restricting builtins.\\n\\nBut perhaps in that case, the math module is available, and anything from there can be used, but the __builtins__ is not accessible. So if the expression is something like math.sqrt(2) + 3, then eval can process that, and since math module is safe (assuming functions like math.sqrt are safe), then that's okay.\\n\\nBut how to handle if the user writes something like math.__import__('os').system('rm -rf /'). But wait, math does not have __import__ because math is a module, and their attributes are limited. So I guess it's relatively safe. Unless someone manages to get dangerous attributes.\\n\\nWait, math is a module. Can we access any dangerous attributes through it? Probably not, but to be safe, maybe limit the allowed functions to only certain ones.\\n\\nBut perhaps it's easier to just include the math module.\\n\\nSo the code would be:\\n\\nimport math\\n\\ndef safely_execute_expression(expression_code: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        allowed_globals = {'__builtins__': None, 'math': math}\\n        result = eval(expression_code, allowed_globals)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Unsafe Code Detected!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut is this safe? What if someone tries to call math.os or other modules? Well, math doesn't have 'os' as an attribute, so trying to access math.os would raise an AttributeError, which would trigger the exception and return \\\"Unsafe Code Detected!\\\".\\n\\nWait, but math is a module; however, if there's a way to get into other modules through math module's attributes. For example, the math module doesn't have any such references. So, if the user writes 'math.__import__(\\\"os\\\").system(\\\"echo hello\\\")', then math.__import__ is invalid because the math module's __import__ is not present. Python modules do have __builtins__ if not restricted, but in our allowed_globals, __builtins__ is set to None, so when the math module is accessed, does its own __builtins__ or environment affect this?\\n\\nWait, when eval is called with allowed_globals, the math module's functions are already imported and the allowed_globals include the math module. Functions in the math module, when called, are part of the Python environment. However, during evaluation in the restricted context, any access to attributes would be via the math module.\\n\\nTherefore, the code as written would not allow using math to access dangerous functions.\\n\\nBut in this code:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {'__builtins__': None, 'math': math}\\n\\nSo __builtins__ is None. Thus, any attempt to use a built-in function like open(), or access __builtins__ inside the evaluated expression, would result in a NameError because they are not present in the globals dict. Since the math module does not have any function that allows arbitrary code execution, this approach should be safe.\\n\\nThus, the code as revised would safely evaluate mathematical expressions that use math functions, basic operators, numbers, etc., but prevent execution of arbitrary code.\\n\\nBut let's test this scenario:\\n\\nWhat if the user provides the expression \\\"math.sqrt(2)\\\", eval would output 1.414..., which is correct. If they write \\\"math.__dict__['__builtins__']\\\", would that work? math.__dict__ would contain its own attributes. Wait, math's __dict__ includes the module's attributes, but in the allowed_globals, math is the math module, so if someone tries math.__dict__, what happens? But even if they access __builtins__ through math's attributes, they would get the builtins from the math module's perspective, which would default to the actual __builtins__, but in our evaluation context, the __builtins__ has been overridden by None in the eval globals. Hmmm, maybe not—when accessing modules during eval, their own __builtins__ would be the regular ones.\\n\\nWait, maybe this is a problem. For example, if a module's code is executed in a certain environment, but when we import a module like math here, the math module is already loaded and when accessing math, the module's own code may have already executed, but when we then include it in the allowed_globals, and we're evaluating code, the __builtins__ in the eval's globals is set to None. However, when evaluating 'math.__builtins__', that's referencing the math module's own __builtins__, which is the original built-ins. Oh! So eval will look for math in our allowed_globals dict. The math module, being a regular Python module, when imported normally, has its own __builtins__ set to the default built-in functions. So evaluating math.__builtins__ in the eval context would return the actual built-in module, which includes dangerous functions like open or __import__.\\n\\nThus, this approach is insecure because it allows access to the original built-in functions through the math module.\\n\\nSo this code:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {'__builtins__': None, 'math': math}\\n\\nexpression_code = \\\"math.__builtins__['eval']('1+1')\\\"\\n\\nThis would access the actual __builtins__ from the math module, allowing execution of eval again.\\n\\nThus, the previous approach is insecure.\\n\\nSo how to prevent this? Need to deny access to any module's __builtins__.\\n\\nAlternative approach: white-listing allowed functions and variables. For example, rather than including the entire math module, only include specific functions and constants.\\n\\nimport math\\n\\nallowed_globals = {\\n    '__builtins__': None,\\n    'sqrt': math.sqrt,\\n    'sin': math.sin,\\n    'cos': math.cos,\\n    'tan': math.tan,\\n    'pi': math.pi,\\n    'e': math.e,\\n    # Add other allowed functions and constants here.\\n}\\n\\nBut the problem here is that users would need to call sqrt(2) instead of math.sqrt(2). So maybe allow a local namespace that has these functions.\\n\\nAnother problem is that defining the allowed_globals after restricting builtins is not enough, because if the user can find a way to get to the original builtins, then they can execute arbitrary code. The math module itself has a __builtins__ attribute, which refers to the original builtins. Thus, allowing math in the restricted environment would provide access to it.\\n\\nTherefore, in order to prevent that, we can't include any modules in the allowed_globals. Instead, we have to copy specific functions into the allowed_globals.\\n\\nThus, the corrected approach is to include only specific functions and constants in the allowed_globals, and not the entire math module.\\n\\nMoreover, also only allow basic numerical operations.\\n\\nSo instead of using the math module, import its functions into the globals:\\n\\nrestrict the code to only use certain functions.\\n\\nIn this case, the user's code can call sqrt(25) directly if we provide that function.\\n\\nThus, modified code:\\n\\nimport math\\n\\ndef safely_execute_expression(expression_code: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        # Define a safe environment preventing access to builtins\\n        # and only allow certain math functions and constants\\n        allowed_globals = {\\n            '__builtins__': None,\\n            'sqrt': math.sqrt,\\n            'sin': math.sin,\\n            'cos': math.cos,\\n            'tan': math.tan,\\n            'pi': math.pi,\\n            'e': math.e,\\n        }\\n        result = eval(expression_code, {'__builtins__': None}, allowed_globals)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Unsafe Code Detected!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, the eval function takes globals and locals. Normally, if using eval(expr, globals), then the locals default to globals. In this case, global dict is {'__builtins__': None} and allowed_globals would not be used. Wait, wait, perhaps the allowed_globals is passed as the globals dict. Wait, no, no. If we create a globals dict that has {'__builtins__': None} but also include the math functions as part of the globals. Or perhaps:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {}\\n\\nallowed_globals['__builtins__'] = None\\nallowed_globals.update({\\n    'sqrt': math.sqrt,\\n    'sin': math.sin,\\n    ...,\\n})\\n\\nThus, the allowed_globals includes the __builtins__ as None and the other allowed functions.\\n\\nSo the code would create a safe environment with only allowed math functions and no access to built-in functions.\\n\\nIn this setup, if someone tries to call eval(math.__builtins__), but since the allowed_globals (when passed as the globals parameter to eval) contains __builtins__: None, then code in the evaluated expression cannot access the built-ins through allowed_globals. But wait, math.sqrt is a function inside the math module. However, when we access functions that came from modules which may have a reference to the built-ins, then during their execution, doesn't that pose a risk?\\n\\nWait, in allowed_globals we have sqrt as math.sqrt. So, when evaluating sqrt(4), the function called is the math.sqrt function. This function itself is a part of the math module, which was imported under the original environment. However, within the scope of the eval, the math.sqrt function isn't a problem, since it's a built-in function (from the math module, but the math module's code has already been executed and the function's behavior is fixed). So as long as the allowed functions don't expose ways to get back into unsafe modules, it should be safe.\\n\\nBut again, suppose someone tries to access the original built-ins through the allowed functions' own __globals__ or other attributes. For example, maybe:\\n\\nexpression_code = \\\"sqrt.__globals__['__builtins__'].eval('os.system(\\\\\\\"echo hello\\\\\\\")')\\\"\\n\\nWait, if sqrt is math.sqrt, then sqrt.__globals__ would be the global namespace of the math module, which does include __builtins__. So accessing sqrt.__globals__ could allow retrieving the builtins, which include dangerous functions.\\n\\nThis is a potential attack vector. For example:\\n\\nexpression_code = \\\"sqrt.__globals__['__builtins__']('exit')\\\".\\n\\nSo if a malicious user can get to __builtins__ via a function's __globals__, then they can perform code execution.\\n\\nThus, even if __builtins__ is set to None in the eval globals, if anywhere in the available functions (like sqrt) there is access to the original builtins, the code is still vulnerable.\\n\\nSo using any function from a module that wasn't carefully audited could leak the builtins.\\n\\nThus, the only safe approach is to use literal_eval if possible, but in this case, that's not feasible since the code is supposed to evaluate mathematical expressions.\\n\\nAlternative approach: parse the expression using the ast module and check that the nodes are allowed.\\n\\nFor example, walk through the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the expression and check that:\\n\\n- Only allowed nodes are present, such as expressions involving numbers, allowed operators, allowed function calls.\\n- Forbid any function calls that are not explicitly allowed.\\n- Forbid any variable names that are not in a whitelist.\\n- Etc.\\n\\nThis approach is more involved but can provide more security.\\n\\nMaybe use ast.parse to parse the expression into an AST, then inspect each node:\\n\\nThe steps would be:\\n\\n1. Parse the expression into an AST.\\n2. Check each node in the AST to ensure it's allowed (e.g., only numbers, allowed operators, allowed function calls).\\n3. If any disallowed nodes are found, mark as unsafe.\\n4. If it passes all checks, then evaluate the expression in a very restricted environment.\\n\\nImplementing this can be quite complex.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a third-party library like 'simpleeval' or 'asteval' which handle safe evaluation.\\n\\nAssuming that the user cannot use third-party libraries, then perhaps the only way is to manually restrict the eval environment as much as possible.\\n\\nSo to mitigate the __builtins__ access through function __globals__, like sqrt.__globals__['__builtins__'], there is an issue. Hence, including any modules or functions in the allowed_globals could be risky.\\n\\nSo perhaps copying the safe functions into the allowed namespace and stripping any potentially dangerous attributes.\\n\\nBut how?\\n\\nAlternatively, use wrappers that disallow access to __globals__.\\n\\nThis is complicated. Maybe worried about this being a possible attack vector. How to ensure that the allowed functions do not have references to __builtins__?\\n\\nWell, maybe even writing custom functions that don't have references to __builtins\"},\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":313,\"completion_tokens\":4096,\"total_tokens\":4409},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

Pickle can execute arbitrary code during deserialization, leading to security exploits.\\n\\nThe task says the function must only allow approved formats. But which ones are approved?

The Bandit report says it's a high severity issue because using a shell with os.system can lead to command injection attacks. Let me think about how to address this.\\n\\nRight, using subprocess.run with shell=False (which is the default) is safer because it avoids shell injection. Instead of constructing the command as a string, I should split it into a list of arguments. That way, each argument is properly escaped, and there's no risk of injecting malicious commands through the md_path or output_pdf_path variables.\\n\\nSo the original command is \\\"pandoc {md_path} -o {output_pdf_path}\\\". Breaking that down into a list would be [\\\"pandoc\\\", md_path, \\\"-o\\\", output_pdf_path]. Oh, right, and check that the paths are valid. Oh wait, the function already checks if md_path exists and ends with .md. So that part is okay.\\n\\nThen, replace os.system with subprocess.run. Using subprocess.run, I can capture the exit code. But wait, how does os.system return the exit code versus subprocess.run? Oh, os.system returns the exit code as a 16-bit number, while subprocess.run's returncode attribute directly gives the exit code. So instead of exit_code = os.system(...), I should do something like result = subprocess.run(command_list), then check result.returncode.\\n\\nAlso, the logging line says \\\"Running command: %s\\\", command. But if we split the command into a list, the logged command would look like the original string. Hmm, maybe we can log the command as a string for clarity, but the actual execution is with the list. Or maybe reconstruct the command as a string for logging but execute the list. But logging the actual command executed, maybe just log the parts together. Wait, perhaps log the same command string as before, even though it's now split. Because the user might be used to seeing that. But actually, when we use the list form with subprocess, it's not run through the shell, so parameters are passed directly. So logging the list as it is might be better. However, the logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command) line is using the original command variable. So I need to set command as the list, but log it properly.\\n\\nWait, maybe the original code built the command as a string, which was then executed via os.system. To make the logging consistent, maybe I should form a command string for logging but split it into the list for execution. But that might not be safe. Alternatively, log the list as a command. Let's think. The original line is:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\n\\nIf I split command into a list, then command is a list like [\\\"pandoc\\\", \\\"input.md\\\", \\\"-o\\\", \\\"output.pdf\\\"], so logging it would show as the list. But that might not look as nice. The alternative is to create a shell-escaped string for logging purposes. But maybe that's overcomplicating. The user would see the same command string in the logs, but internally, it's executed safely.\\n\\nWait, but in the fixed code, we can't use a single string for the command. Because if we set command to the list, then os.system expects a string, but subprocess.run with shell=False expects a list. Hmm, so maybe adjust the logging. Let's split that:\\n\\nOriginal code built command as a string, logged it, then ran os.system. In the fixed code, the command is a list. So to log it properly, we can construct a string for logging purposes only. But how to do that without reintroducing security issues?\\n\\nAlternatively, since we are logging the command before running it, we can just log the parts as they are joined. For example, for logging, do \\\" \\\".join(command_list). But is that safe? Well, the logging is for information purposes, but the actual execution is using the list, which is safe. So even if the log shows the command as a string, since execution uses the list, there's no injection possible. So perhaps modifying the code as follows:\\n\\nChange 'command' to be the list:\\n\\ncommand = [\\\"pandoc\\\", md_path, \\\"-o\\\", output_pdf_path]\\n\\nThen, for logging, do:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", \\\" \\\".join(command))\\n\\nBut wait, joining the command with spaces is not entirely safe because arguments with spaces would be misrepresented in the log. But logging is just for user visibility; the actual command is executed with subprocess using the list, which properly handles spaces or special characters in filenames. So maybe this is acceptable.\\n\\nBut then, when you log the command by joining with spaces, it might not be the exact command that would be run if there were spaces or other characters. However, pandoc itself would receive the correct arguments. So the logging may not be 100% accurate, but it's the best we can do for informative logging without making the code vulnerable.\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nChange os.system(command) to subprocess.run(command, check=False). Then, capture the exit code.\\n\\nWait, we can use subprocess.run() and set shell=False (which is the default). Then, check the returncode.\\n\\nSo here's how to structure it:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command, shell=False).returncode\\n\\nBut wait, the code expects an exit code. Alternatively, capture CompletedProcess instance:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run(command, shell=False)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nAlso, make sure that command is a list, e.g., [\\\"pandoc\\\", md_path, \\\"-o\\\", output_pdf_path].\\n\\nAdditionally, handle possible exceptions. But since the original code doesn't catch exceptions, perhaps it's okay to leave it as-is, just change the command execution method.\\n\\nPutting this all together:\\n\\nOriginal code setup:\\n\\ncommand = f\\\"pandoc {md_path} -o {output_pdf_path}\\\"\\n\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\n\\nFix steps:\\n\\n1. Split the command into a list.\\n2. Use subprocess.run with the list and capture the exit code.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\ncommand = [\\\"pandoc\\\", md_path, \\\"-o\\\", output_pdf_path]\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", \\\" \\\".join(command))\\nresult = subprocess.run(command)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nWait, but subprocess.run returns a CompletedProcess object. So we can:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode\\n\\nBut then if any errors occur (like command not found), would it raise an exception? The original code uses os.system, which doesn't raise, but returns the exit code. So the original code captures exit code, and continues. So the fixed code should do the same.\\n\\nYes, so using subprocess.run with check=False (by default check is False), so it doesn't raise, then getting the returncode.\\n\\nSo perhaps:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode\\n\\nBut perhaps better to write:\\n\\nprocess = subprocess.run(command)\\nexit_code = process.returncode\\n\\nAlternatively:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command, shell=False).returncode\\n\\nThough shell=False is the default.\\n\\nSo updating the code:\\n\\nChange the command to a list, log it by joining with spaces, execute via subprocess.run(), capture return code.\\n\\nAlso, remember to import subprocess if not already imported. The original code uses os.system, which probably means os is imported. But assuming subprocess is available.\\n\\nThus, the corrected code would have the following changes:\\n\\nOriginal:\\n\\ncommand = f\\\"pandoc {md_path} -o {output_pdf_path}\\\"\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\n\\nFixed:\\n\\ncommand = [\\\"pandoc\\\", md_path, \\\"-o\\\", output_pdf_path]\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", \\\" \\\".join(command))\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode\\n\\nBut need to import subprocess.\\n\\nDoes the original code have an import for subprocess? The problem says the code is the vulnerable snippet. The vulnerable code probably imported os. The fixed code should import subprocess.\\n\\nWait, in the given code snippet:\\n\\nThe code uses os.system and os.path.exists, so os is imported. The fixed code uses subprocess.run, so they need to have 'import subprocess' at the top. So the user would need to add that import. Otherwise, the code will raise a NameError.\\n\\nAssuming that in the given code, os and logger are properly imported.\\n\\nSo the fixed code should include 'import subprocess' if not already there. However, according to the problem statement, the user is to provide only the code snippet of the function, possibly in the context where os and submodule exists.\\n\\nWait, the problem says \\\"provide the corrected version of the code\\\". So we should include all necessary imports in the code? But wait, the original code as provided seems to include only the function (the code begins with the function definition, and the helper text is part of the comment). So if the original code didn't import os, but in reality it must have. Because it uses os.path.exists and os.system. So the original code likely has:\\n\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\n\\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # or similar\\n\\nBut the user included the function snippet. When the user provides the corrected code, they may just show the function. But perhaps the assistant's answer should also include any necessary new imports.\\n\\nBut according to the instruction: \\\"Your response should only include the code, do not output anything else!!!\\\"\\n\\nBut given that the original code uses os.system, os is already imported. The corrected code uses subprocess, so adding an import subprocess is needed. But is that part of the code? The assistant's answer must be only the code, including necessary imports.\\n\\nThe original vulnerable code's function uses os.system and os.path.exists, so that code would have 'import os' somewhere. But the fixed code uses subprocess. Therefore, the fixed code's function would need to have 'import subprocess' added.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code would need an import for subprocess if it's not already present. But within the function? No, imports are at the top of the module.\\n\\nBut how can the assistant know whether to include imports? The original code in the function uses os.path and os.system, which must mean that the module includes 'import os'. However, the corrected code switches to using subprocess, so the module needs to import subprocess.\\n\\nBut since the code snippet provided is the function, the import may be outside. However, when fixing the code, we have to ensure that the subprocess is imported. Thus, the assistant's answer should include the necessary import statement if it's missing in the original code.\\n\\nBut the vulnerable code that the user provided may not show the import, only the function. The assistant's job is to provide the fixed function. However, given that Bandit's report indicated the issue is with os.system, the correct fix is to switch to subprocess. So in the corrected code, perhaps the assistant needs to modify the function and ensure that subprocess is imported.\\n\\nThus, assuming the import of subprocess wasn't there in the original code, but the function must now use it, how to handle it? The question didn't show the imports but asked for the fixed code.\\n\\nGiven the problem statement likely expects the code to substitute the use of os.system with a secure subprocess approach, and the code will need to import subprocess.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code would need to include an import for subprocess if it's not already present. But whether the user code had it or not, the problem says to \\\"provide the corrected version of the code\\\".\\n\\nHowever, according to the original code provided by the user, the function did NOT include the import statements, as the code snippet starts with the function definition. So including the imports in the corrected code would be necessary.\\n\\nAlternatively, the user may already have the necessary imports, but in the context here, the assistant may need to include them.\\n\\nBut given the instruction says to \\\"provide the corrected version of the code\\\" and only the code, I think that I should assume that the necessary imports are present, except for subprocess which needs to be imported now.\\n\\nBut the original code imports os. The corrected code needs to also import subprocess, so in the fixed code, the function would have to be in a module that includes:\\n\\nimport os\\nimport subprocess\\nimport logging\\n\\nBut in the code snippet, do we need to add the import for subprocess? If the original code didn't have it, our fixed code must include it. But since the code provided by the user (the vulnerable one) is a function, perhaps the assistant is to correct only the function body and any necessary top-level imports. So including 'import subprocess' at the top would be required.\\n\\nBut the user's code delivers the following as the original code (excluding imports):\\n\\ndef convert_md_to_pdf(md_path: str, output_pdf_path: str):\\n    ...\\n\\nThus, in the fixed code, the function must be adjusted to use subprocess, and the code must have the necessary imports.\\n\\nTherefore, the assistant's answer should include the necessary imports, but according to the original code's structure. However, the original code snippet didn't include any imports, only the function. So should the fixed code include the imports?\\n\\nBy default, if the code is part of a full Python module, it would have the needed imports. But according to the problem statement, maybe not.\\n\\nHmm. The user wrote that the vulnerable code is as given. So their code may already have 'import os' but not 'import subprocess'. So when providing the fixed code, the assistant should include the addition of 'import subprocess' at the top of the code snippet.\\n\\nBut according to the problem's instructions, \\\"Your response should only include the code, do not output anything else!!!\\\"\\n\\nLooking at the sample answer by the assistant (helper's instructions), if the original code snippet starts with the function definition, then the corrected version would also include only the function with modified code and any new imports needed.\\n\\nWait, but the original code provided by the user has a comment and then a function. So perhaps in the fixed version, we must include the imports required for that function.\\n\\nLooking at the problem's original code:\\n\\nThe function uses:\\n\\nimport os (because it uses os.path and os.system)\\nlogger (which would need to have a logging import)\\n\\nBut the code snippet provided is just the function. However, it's common in Python to have the imports at the top of the file. Thus, to make the code self-contained, the fixed version should include any necessary imports. Alternatively, if the code is part of a larger module, then imports may already exist, but the problem only provides the function.\\n\\nHowever, given that the fixed code uses a module (subprocess) that wasn't used before, it's safer to include the import.\\n\\nBut if the original code didn't have 'import subprocess', the fixed code would need to include it. Therefore, the assistant's answer should include the necessary import.\\n\\nBut the user's input code starts with a comment and the function. Let me see: the user's vulnerable code starts with:\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nThis function performs...\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\ndef convert_md_to_pdf(...):\\n    ...\\n\\nThus, the code given is the function with the docstring and code body. No imports shown. However, the code uses os.path.exists, os.system, and logging (logger). Therefore, the code relies on these modules being imported elsewhere. When providing the corrected version, we need to switch to use subprocess.run, but do we need to include 'import subprocess'?\\n\\nThe answer is that the code can't be correct without importing subprocess, so the assistant's corrected version must include the necessary imports. However, the problem says \\\"the code snippet\\\" and in the original problem, perhaps the imports were at the top of the file but not visible in the code snippet.\\n\\nAlternatively, the user expects the assistant to correct only the function, and the existing module includes the necessary import.\\n\\nThe tricky part is whether including an import in the answer is required. Since the original code uses os and the fixed code continues to use os (for os.path), the existing 'import os' remains. The function now uses subprocess, so we need to have 'import subprocess'.\\n\\nHowever, given that the code submitted in response is only the fixed function, then the assistant's answer cannot include import statements. Therefore, assuming that the rest of the module has the required imports, the fixed function would logically be as follows.\\n\\nSo the key steps for the fix are:\\n\\n1. Replace the os.system call with subprocess.run.\\n\\n2. Split the command into a list to avoid shell injection.\\n\\n3. Adjust the logging to print the command as a string.\\n\\nThus, the corrected code would look like this:\\n\\n...\\ndef convert_md_to_pdf(md_path: str, output_pdf_path: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Converts a markdown file to a PDF using pandoc.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Converting markdown file to PDF...\\\")\\n    if not os.path.exists(md_path):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Markdown file not found: %s\\\", md_path)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"Markdown file not found: {md_path}\\\")\\n    if not md_path.endswith('.md'):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Invalid file type: %s\\\", md_path)\\n        return\\n    command = [\\\"pandoc\\\", md_path, \\\"-o\\\", output_pdf_path]\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", \\\" \\\".join(command))\\n    exit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Markdown converted to PDF successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to convert markdown to PDF; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n\\nBut the code above uses subprocess.run, so the module must import subprocess. If the original code didn't do that, the corrected code will fail. Thus, the assistant's answer should include the import statement. However, according to the problem's sample code, the user's code snippet starts with the function, and the assistant is supposed to 'provide the corrected version of the code' implying the same code structure but fixed.\\n\\nBut in Python, each .py file must import the required modules. So adding the import is necessary.\\n\\nBut where should the import statement be placed?\\n\\nAt the top of the code snippet. So if the correct answer adds import subprocess at the top of the file, before the function.\\n\\nBut in the original code shown by the user, there are no import statements. But given that the function uses os and a logger, we can assume that the existing code includes these imports. However, the corrected code adding subprocess must import it.\\n\\nBut since the user's code snippet does not include these, should the corrected code include the import?\\n\\nThis is a bit ambiguous. To be safe, maybe the assistant should include the necessary import in the fixed code.\\n\\nSo, adjusted corrected code with required imports:\\n\\nimport os\\nimport subprocess\\nimport logging\\n\\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\n\\ndef convert_md_to_pdf(md_path: str, output_pdf_path: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Converts a markdown file to a PDF using pandoc.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Converting markdown file to PDF...\\\")\\n    if not os.path.exists(md_path):\\n        logger.error(\\\"Markdown file not found: %s\\\", md_path)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"Markdown file not found: {md_path}\\\")\\n    if\"},\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":467,\"completion_tokens\":4096,\"total_tokens\":4563},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit report mentions using ast.literal_eval instead, but wait, in this context, they're using eval to evaluate conditions in the WHERE clause. Replacing eval with literal_eval might not work because literal_eval only evaluates literals, not expressions. Maybe that's not the right approach here.\\n\\nLet me think. The problem is that using eval with user-provided input can execute arbitrary code. So to prevent injection, instead of dynamically evaluating the conditions, I should parse the WHERE clause safely. How can I process the conditions without using eval?\\n\\nMaybe split each condition into parts, like field, operator, value, and then check each part against the record. For example, a condition like \\\"age \\u003e 25\\\" would split into field \\\"age\\\", operator \\\"\\u003e\\\", and value 25. Then for each record, compare the record's value using the operator.\\n\\nBut this requires handling different operators (like =, !=, \\u003c, \\u003e, etc.) and possibly different data types. So parse each condition into a tuple of (field, operator, value), then for each record, apply the comparison.\\n\\nSo the steps would be:\\n\\n1. Parse each condition from the WHERE clause into a list of (field, operator, value).\\n2. For each record, check all these parsed conditions.\\n3. Replace the eval-based lambda with a function that uses these parsed conditions.\\n\\nThis way, there's no use of eval, so no code injection.\\n\\nSo first, modify where the lambda is defined. The current code splits conditions using AND, then joins with ' and ' and evals. That's where the vulnerability is.\\n\\nLet me create a helper function to parse each condition.\\n\\nFor example, split \\\"age \\u003e 25\\\" into field 'age', operator '\\u003e', value 25.\\n\\nBut parsing the condition correctly requires handling operators that might be part of the string, like \\\"name='John Doe'\\\" if allowed, which would complicate things.\\n\\nWait, the original code uses where_clause.split('AND') to split into individual conditions, but then in the eval, it combines them with ' and ', effectively creating a Python expression. So modifying that part to use manual condition checking instead.\\n\\nSo the plan is to process each condition into a checkable predicate without evaluating arbitrary code.\\n\\nLet's think: For each condition in where_clause (split by AND), parse each into field, operator, value.\\n\\nThe code could look like this:\\n\\nconditions = where_clause.split(' AND ')  # Assume split by ' AND ', need to handle case and possible whitespace\\npredicates = []\\nfor cond in conditions:\\n    # Need to parse condition into parts. Maybe using a regex.\\n    # A regex pattern that captures field, operator, value.\\n    # Possible operators: =, !=, \\u003c, \\u003e, \\u003c=, \\u003e=, etc.\\n    # Regex could be like (\\\\w+)\\\\s*(=|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.+)\\n    # But need to handle values that are strings with quotes or numbers.\\n\\nBut handling this correctly is complex. For simplicity, let's split on operator-like patterns.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each condition, split into left and right parts based on operator, but handling that is error-prone.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a safe evaluator that only allows comparisons to the record's fields.\\n\\nWait, maybe create a list of lambda functions, each checking a condition in a safe way. Wait, but the lambda would also involve evaluation. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each condition, split into parts, and compare the record's field against the value using the operator.\\n\\nFor example, for condition \\\"age\\u003e25\\\", extract field 'age', operator '\\u003e', value 25. Then when checking a record, take rec['age'], check if it's greater than 25.\\n\\nBut how to handle the operator? Can map the operator strings to functions. Like:\\n\\noperator_map = {\\n    '=': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n    '!=': lambda a, b: a != b,\\n    '\\u003c': lambda a, b: a \\u003c b,\\n    '\\u003e': lambda a, b: a \\u003e b,\\n    '\\u003c=': lambda a, b: a \\u003c= b,\\n    '\\u003e=': lambda a, b: a \\u003e= b,\\n}\\n\\nBut need to parse each condition into these parts.\\n\\nThen, for each condition, we can parse into (field, op, value), then create a check function that uses operator_map[op](rec[field], parsed_value).\\n\\nBut how to parse the condition string into these parts?\\n\\nLet me try to think of a regular expression that can split the condition into field, operator, and value.\\n\\nFor instance, using re.match(r'^(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(=|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.*)$', cond.strip()))\\n\\nBut this might not account for cases where the value is a string in quotes, which could be either part of the regex match. Wait, but in SQL-like syntax, strings are usually in quotes. However, since the dataset is a list of Python dicts, the values should correspond to Python values.\\n\\nBut in the original code's eval approach, it's expecting conditions to refer to keys in the record dict. But the code could use something like \\\"name == 'Alice'\\\" as a condition, which is directly evaluated in the scope of the record. But using this approach is dangerous because what if someone passes \\\"os.system('rm -rf /')\\\" as part of the condition? Which would execute that code.\\n\\nSo replacing eval with a parser that handles the conditions safely.\\n\\nSo I need to parse each condition into field, operator, and value, then use these to build a lambda that compares the record's field to the value using the operator.\\n\\nLet's see:\\n\\nEach condition is like \\\"field op value\\\"\\n\\nSo splitting that into field_part, operator_part, value_part.\\n\\nBut due to possible spaces and different operators, I need a regex to capture these.\\n\\nSomething like:\\n\\npattern = r'^(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e|=)\\\\s*\\\"?(.*?)\\\"?$'\\n\\nWait, not sure. Maybe another approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, split the condition on whitespace, but operators like '\\u003c=' contain two characters.\\n\\nWait, perhaps split into tokens. But that's more complex. Let me look for a regex that can split into left-hand side and right-hand side.\\n\\nAnother approach: use the operator's symbols to split.\\n\\nFor example, for a condition like \\\"age\\u003e=30\\\", split into \\\"age\\\", \\\"\\u003e=\\\", \\\"30\\\".\\n\\nThe regex could be:\\n\\nr'^(.+?)(=|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e)(.+?)$'\\n\\nBut that might not work correctly because the left part could have characters that are part of the operator. Maybe a positive lookbehind.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a regex with groups for field, operator, and value. Maybe:\\n\\nimport re\\nop_pattern = r'(==|!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|\\u003c|\\u003e|=)'\\nfor cond in conditions:\\n    cond = cond.strip()\\n    parts = re.split(op_pattern, cond, 1)\\n    if len(parts) \\u003c 3:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid condition: {cond}\\\")\\n    field_part = parts[0].strip()\\n    op_part = parts[1].strip()\\n    value_part = parts[2].strip()\\n    # Now try to parse value_part into appropriate Python type\\n    # For example, if it's a quoted string, then strip quotes and use as string\\n    # If numeric, convert to int/float\\n    # For simplicity, perhaps use ast.literal_eval on the value_part\\n    try:\\n        value = ast.literal_eval(value_part)\\n    except:\\n        # If it's a string without quotes, maybe keep as string?\\n        value = value_part\\n    operator_map = {\\n        '=': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n        '==': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n        '!=': lambda a, b: a != b,\\n        '\\u003c': lambda a, b: a \\u003c b,\\n        '\\u003e': lambda a, b: a \\u003e b,\\n        '\\u003c=': lambda a, b: a \\u003c= b,\\n        '\\u003e=': lambda a, b: a \\u003e= b,\\n    }\\n    if op_part not in operator_map:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator: {op_part}\\\")\\n    pred = lambda rec, f=field_part, op=op_part, v=value: operator_map[op](rec[f], v)\\n    predicates.append(pred)\\n\\nThen, the filter_conditions is a function that checks all the predicates. Instead of eval, for each record, check all these predicates.\\n\\nThen the filter_conditions function can be:\\n\\nfilter_conditions = lambda rec: all(p(rec) for p in predicates)\\n\\nBut then I have to turn all the conditions into the predicates list correctly.\\n\\nSo the existing conditions processing must be replaced with this new code.\\n\\nBut code might have other details to handle, like handling different data types, like if a value is supposed to be an integer but in the record it's a string, conversions would vary.\\n\\nBut in the original code, the eval uses the record's environment, which includes the dictionary keys. So if the record has 'age' as a key with an integer, then in the condition \\\"age\\u003e25\\\", it's compared correctly.\\n\\nSo to replicate that, in the new code, the field_part is the key, the op_part is the operator, and the value_part is parsed into a Python object, perhaps using ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nWait, but value_part might have variable names, but in our case, they should be literals. Because in a WHERE clause in SQL, your comparing against literals, not columns. So for example, condition is \\\"age \\u003e 30\\\", not \\\"age \\u003e salary\\\".\\n\\nBut to support comparing columns, the code would be more complex. But since the original function uses the eval with rec as the environment, that would allow conditions like \\\"age \\u003e salary\\\" where 'salary' is another field. However, in the parsed SQL-like query, the implementation originally allows that.\\n\\nBut, this is part of the problem: to support that, we need a way to allow field comparisons.\\n\\nWait, but if I attempt to allow this, then the new code needs to parse expressions that include field names. But this complicates the parsing. However, since the original code was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution, any attempts to allow this might present new challenges.\\n\\nAlternatively, the SQL-like query may restrict comparisons to be between fields and literals, not other fields, which would simplify the conditions. But that's a design decision.\\n\\nAssuming that the intended WHERE conditions are expressions where the right-hand side is a literal, then we can parse each condition as left-hand side is a field name, operator, and value.\\n\\nBut if the SQL-like query allows for multiple fields, like \\\"age \\u003e salary\\\", then in the original code eval would retrieve 'salary' from the record and compare. To handle this case in the new code, the parser needs to allow for the right-hand side to be a field name. But evaluating that would require checking for existing keys in the record, perhaps.\\n\\nThis complicates the parsing. For the sake of fixing the vulnerability while maintaining functionality, perhaps it's better to allow field comparisons but parse them safely.\\n\\nAlternatively, restrict the WHERE clause to comparisons between fields and literals. But I need to make that decision based on the original code's intention.\\n\\nLooking back at the original code's comment: \\\"elementary clauses such as SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY\\\". So the user is likely intended to have basic conditions, like \\\"field = value\\\" possibly combined with ANDs.\\n\\nBut regardless of the original intent, the vulnerability comes from using eval, so replacing that with safe parsing is the goal.\\n\\nSo perhaps proceed under the assumption that each condition is a comparison between a field and a literal value, or between two fields.\\n\\nBut for field comparisons, like \\\"field1\\u003efield2\\\", how to parse that?\\n\\nWell, to represent \\\"field1\\u003efield2\\\", we'd need to capture both field1 and field2. But perhaps the operator and the right-hand field.\\n\\nThis increases the complexity significantly.\\n\\nPerhaps the safest approach is to split conditions into three parts: left field, operator, and right field or literal. Then, for each condition, retrieve the left and right values from the record (for fields) or parsed as literals, and apply the operator.\\n\\nThis approach would allow conditions like \\\"age\\u003e30\\\" or \\\"name='John'\\\" or \\\"salary \\u003e= 50000\\\".\\n\\nSo, for each condition:\\n\\n- Parse into left operand, operator, right operand.\\n\\nFor example, for the condition \\\"age \\u003e 30\\\":\\n\\nleft = 'age', op = '\\u003e', right = 30.\\n\\nFor \\\"name = 'John'\\\":\\n\\nleft = 'name', op = '=', right = 'John'.\\n\\nFor \\\"salary \\u003e= bonus\\\":\\n\\nleft = 'salary', op = '\\u003e=', right is the bonus field of the current record.\\n\\nSo during parsing, the right operand could be a literal or a field name.\\n\\nThus, the plan is:\\n\\n1. Split each condition (after splitting by AND) into left, op, right parts.\\n\\n2. For the right part, determine if it's a literal (like 30, 'John') or a field name (bonus).\\n\\n3. When checking the condition: retrieve left_field's value from the record, retrieve right value (either from the record for field or as a literal), then compare using op.\\n\\nSo, parsing the right operand as a literal if it is a quoted string or numeric, else as a field name.\\n\\nTo parse the right_operand:\\n\\n- Check if it's a string enclosed in single or double quotes. If so, strip quotes and use as string.\\n\\n- Else, check if it's numeric (integer/float). If so, convert.\\n\\n- Else, treat it as a field name, and retrieve it from the record.\\n\\nThis way, in code, when processing each condition, during predicate construction:\\n\\nIf the right is a literal, then in the predicate function, retrieve left_field from record, compare to the right literal.\\n\\nIf the right is a field name, retrieve left and right fields from the record compared.\\n\\nThus, for a condition \\\"salary \\u003e bonus\\\", during evaluation, check if rec['salary'] \\u003e rec['bonus'].\\n\\nBut how to parse the right_operand to determine field or literal.\\n\\nSo parsing code could look like this:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef parse_value(s):\\n    s = s.strip()\\n    try:\\n        # Try to parse as a Python literal (e.g., strings, numbers)\\n        # Using ast.literal_eval to safely evaluate the literal\\n        return ast.literal_eval(s)\\n    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):\\n        # If it's not a literal, assume it's a field name\\n        return s\\n\\nBut need to handle cases like \\\"name=John\\\" where John is meant to be a string. Wait, in the original code's usage with eval, maybe \\\"name == 'John'\\\" was necessary. But I the user enters \\\"name = John\\\" expecting John to be a string, that would parse as a field name. Which would compare rec['name'] to rec['John'], which is probably not intended.\\n\\nBut the original code's eval would treat John as a variable, leading to KeyError. So assuming that in this SQL-like query, string literals must be quoted.\\n\\nThus, the user must quote strings in the conditions, which aligns with SQL syntax.\\n\\nSo, for \\\"name='John'\\\", the right operand would be parsed into the string 'John'.\\n\\nBut for \\\"name=John\\\", it's parsed into a field name 'John', and would compare rec['name'] to rec['John'].\\n\\nBut in most cases, users would make a mistake by not quoting strings, leading to incorrect comparisons. However, from a security perspective, this isn't a problem—just a user error.\\n\\nBut from the code's perspective, the predicate function will try to get rec[right_operand], which may throw a KeyError. But in the original code, that would be caught and propagate as an error.

The Bandit analysis points out that using eval is unsafe here. The problem is in the where clause processing where they use eval to evaluate the conditions. That's definitely risky because someone could inject malicious code into the SQL-like query.\\n\\nFirst, how can I replace the eval with something safer? The user mentioned using ast.literal_eval, but I'm not sure that's the right approach here. Maybe I should parse the where conditions manually instead of dynamically evaluating them. Like, parse each condition and check if it's a valid comparison on the item's fields.\\n\\nLet me look at the original code. The where_conditions are split by 'AND', and then joined with ' and ' and evaluated in a lambda. So, for each item in the dataset, the eval is using the item's dictionary as the local namespace. That allows the conditions to reference the item's keys directly, like \\\"age \\u003e 30\\\".\\n\\nBut using eval here is dangerous. For example, if an attacker passes a condition like \\\"__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')\\\", that would execute arbitrary code. So, I need to sanitize or parse the conditions safely.\\n\\nAlternative approach: Instead of allowing any Python expression, I could parse each condition into something like a key, operator, and value. Then, create a function that checks these conditions without using eval. But that might be complex because the where clause could have varied syntax.\\n\\nWait, the problem is that the user wants to process SQL-like queries. So the where conditions are in a SQL-like format. For example, \\\"age \\u003e 30 AND name = 'Alice'\\\". The current code turns them into \\\"age \\u003e 30 and name = 'Alice'\\\", then uses eval in the item's context.\\n\\nTo remove eval, perhaps parse each condition in the where clause individually. Split each condition into parts: the key, the operator, and the value. Then, for each part, compare against the item in a safe way.\\n\\nFor instance, split \\\"age \\u003e 30\\\" into field='age', operator='\\u003e', value='30'. Then, check in the item if item['age'] \\u003e 30. But how do I handle different operators like '=', '!=', '\\u003c', etc.?\\n\\nI can create a mapping from operator strings to actual comparison functions. Let's see:\\n\\nFirst, split each where_condition into parts. But parsing the condition correctly is the challenging part. We need to handle not just spaces, but also different operators which can have different lengths (like '=', '\\u003e=', etc.). For example, \\\"name='Alice'\\\" or \\\"height \\u003e= 180\\\". \\n\\nMaybe use a regular expression to split each condition into field, operator, and value. Something like:\\n\\nFor each condition in where_conditions:\\n\\nParse it with a regex like (\\\\w+)\\\\s*([=\\u003c\\u003e!]+)\\\\s*'?(.*?)'?\\n\\nBut this could get complicated. For example, handling string values with quotes, numbers, etc.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a regex to capture the parts: perhaps using something like (\\\\w+)\\\\s*(!=|\\u003c=|\\u003e=|=|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.+)\\n\\nBut even that may not cover all cases. Then, the value can be a literal (string or number). So, parse the value using ast.literal_eval to safely convert it into a Python type.\\n\\nSo, steps to replace the eval:\\n\\n1. Split where_conditions into individual conditions (split by 'AND').\\n\\n2. For each condition:\\n\\n   a. Parse it into field, operator, and value.\\n\\n   b. Convert the value into a literal (using ast.literal_eval for safety).\\n\\n   c. Compare the item's field value with the parsed operator and value.\\n\\nBut implementing this parsing may require a regular expression. Let me create a regex that captures the field name, operator, and value. For example:\\n\\nThe regex could be something like r\\\"(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(=|!=|\\u003e=|\\u003c=|\\u003e|\\u003c)\\\\s*(.*)\\\" — but we need to handle the operators properly, checking for valid ones.\\n\\nWait, maybe the regex could match all operators. Let me look for a pattern where an operator is any combination of =, \\u003c, \\u003e, !, etc. Alternatively, split on operators, but that's error-prone.\\n\\nAlternatively, the order of checking operators matters. For example, check for '\\u003e=', then '\\u003e', because checking '\\u003e first would also match '\\u003e=' and split the '= part into the value.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a regex that can capture the possible operators.\\n\\nHere's an approach:\\n\\nFor each condition in where_conditions:\\n\\n- Split the condition into parts using a regex like:\\n\\n^(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==?|!=|\\u003e=?|\\u003c=?)\\\\s*(.*)$\\n\\nBut the problem is handling the quotes around strings. For example, \\\"name = 'Alice'\\\" would have the value part as \\\"'Alice'\\\". The current code uses eval and can handle it, but ast.literal_eval can parse that into 'Alice' if we strip the quotes.\\n\\nAlternatively, parse the value using ast.literal_eval, which can handle strings, numbers, etc. But only for literals.\\n\\nSo, in code:\\n\\nFor each condition:\\n\\nMatch with a regex to get field, operator, and value_str.\\n\\nThen, parse value_str with ast.literal_eval to get the value.\\n\\nThen, when evaluating the condition, check item[field] against the parsed operator and value.\\n\\nSo, replacing the eval with this logic.\\n\\nSo the original code's filter_func uses eval, which is replaced with a function built from this parsed information.\\n\\nLet's code this step.\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\nwhere_conditions = where_clause.split('AND')\\n\\n# In the vulnerable part:\\nfilter_func = lambda item: eval(' and '.join(where_conditions), item)\\n\\nBut instead of eval, apply each parsed condition.\\n\\nSo, after splitting into where_conditions_list (split by AND), for each condition, parse into (field, operator, value).\\n\\nThen, for each item in the dataset, check that all conditions are met.\\n\\nBut how to handle operator mapping.\\n\\nPossible operator mapping:\\n\\noperator_map = {\\n    '==': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n    '=': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n    '!=': lambda a, b: a != b,\\n    '\\u003e=': lambda a, b: a \\u003e= b,\\n    '\\u003c=': lambda a, b: a \\u003c= b,\\n    '\\u003e': lambda a, b: a \\u003e b,\\n    '\\u003c': lambda a, b: a \\u003c b,\\n}\\n\\nThen, for each parsed condition (field, op, val), we can retrieve the appropriate operator function.\\n\\nBut ensure that op is a valid key in operator_map. Otherwise, raise an error about invalid operator.\\n\\nSo, putting all together:\\n\\nParse each condition:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\nconditions = []\\n\\nfor condition in where_conditions:\\n    # Remove any leading/trailing whitespace\\n    condition = condition.strip()\\n    # Use regex to split into parts\\n    match = re.match(r\\\"^\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==?|!=|\\u003e=?|\\u003c=?|\\u003c|\\u003e)\\\\s*(.+?)\\\\s*$\\\", condition)\\n    if not match:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid condition: {condition}\\\")\\n    field, op, value_str = match.groups()\\n    # Parse the value using ast.literal_eval (safely)\\n    try:\\n        value = ast.literal_eval(value_str)\\n    except ValueError:\\n        value = value_str  # fallback if not a literal. Hmm, maybe not safe. Wait, literal_eval can handle strings if quoted.\\n        # Wait, for example, value_str might be \\\"'Alice'\\\" or \\\"42\\\", or \\\"3.14\\\". When using ast.literal_eval, \\\"'Alice'\\\" would be parsed as the string Alice. But if the value is not quoted, like Alice, that would cause a syntax error. So perhaps the SQL-like query expects string values to be quoted. So it's the user's responsibility to provide valid literals. So when parsing the value_str, ast.literal_eval will throw an error if it's invalid, which will raise ValueError. So we catch that and fail the query.\\n\\n    if op not in operator_map:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator: {op} in condition {condition}\\\")\\n\\n    conditions.append( (field, op, value) )\\n\\nThen, the filter function would check for each condition:\\n\\ndef filter_func(item):\\n    for field, op, value in conditions:\\n        operator_func = operator_map[op]\\n        if field not in item:\\n            return False  # field not present\\n        if not operator_func(item[field], value):\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\nBut need to handle cases where the item does not have the field. So, perhaps better to return false, since the condition wouldn't be met.\\n\\nThe advantage here is that we don't evaluate arbitrary code, but instead parse the conditions into a structured format and validate against the data.\\n\\nThis approach should eliminate the code injection vulnerability.\\n\\nSo, replacing the where clause processing with this parsed conditions logic.\\n\\nNow implementing this into the original code.\\n\\nFirst, replace the where_conditions processing.\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\nwhere_conditions = where_clause.split('AND')\\nfilter_func = lambda item: eval(' and '.join(where_conditions), item)\\n\\nReplace this with the parsing code as discussed.\\n\\nSo, inside the try block:\\n\\nOperator_map can be a dictionary defined inside the function.\\n\\nAfter parsing select_fields:\\n\\n# Process WHERE clause\\nwhere_conditions_list = [cond.strip() for cond in where_clause.split('AND') if cond.strip()]\\n\\noperator_map = {\\n    '==': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n    '=': lambda a, b: a == b,\\n    '!=': lambda a, b: a != b,\\n    '\\u003e=': lambda a, b: a \\u003e= b,\\n    '\\u003c=': lambda a, b: a \\u003c= b,\\n    '\\u003e': lambda a, b: a \\u003e b,\\n    '\\u003c': lambda a, b: a \\u003c b,\\n}\\n\\nconditions = []\\nfor condition in where_conditions_list:\\n    # Use regex to parse each condition into field, operator, value\\n    # The regex accounts for possible whitespace around the operator\\n    # Matches a word (field), operator (like =, !=, \\u003e=, \\u003c=, \\u003e, \\u003c), then the remainder as value\\n    # For example, 'age \\u003e 30' becomes groups ('age', '\\u003e', '30')\\n    # The value_str will be parsed with ast.literal_eval\\n    match = re.match(r\\\"^\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(=|!=|\\u003e=|\\u003c=|\\u003e|\\u003c)\\\\s*(.*)\\\\s*$\\\", condition)\\n    if not match:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid condition: {condition}\\\")\\n    field, operator, value_str = match.groups()\\n    # Now safely parse the value\\n    try:\\n        value = ast.literal_eval(value_str.strip())\\n    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid value in condition: {value_str}\\\")\\n    if operator not in operator_map:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator: {operator}\\\")\\n    conditions.append( (field, operator, value) )\\n\\nThen, the filter function:\\n\\ndef filter_func(item):\\n    for field, op, val in conditions:\\n        # Check if field exists in item, else return False\\n        if field not in item:\\n            return False\\n        # Get the corresponding operator function\\n        op_func = operator_map[op]\\n        # Apply the operator to item's value and the parsed value\\n        if not op_func(item[field], val):\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\nThen, use this filter_func with filter.\\n\\nBut in Python, using a list comprehension with filter is possible, but the original code uses filter. So, in code:\\n\\nresult = filter(filter_func, dataset)\\n\\nThen rest as before.\\n\\nThis approach replaces the dangerous eval with a safe parser, avoiding code injection.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code would have:\\n\\n- Split where_clause into AND-separated conditions.\\n- For each condition, parse field, operator, value with a regex.\\n- Check operator against a known set and parsed value with ast.literal_eval.\\n- Build a list of conditions to check, then use a filter function that checks each item against all conditions.\\n\\nSo the eval is eliminated, thus fixing the vulnerability reported by Bandit.\\n\\nNow, checking if there are other potential vulnerabilities. The order_by_clause could be vulnerable to code injection if it's using a field that's not present. In the current code, when sorted by x[order_by_field], if order_by_field is not in the item, it will raise a KeyError. But the code is in a try-except block, which catches exceptions and raises a ValueError. So that's acceptable.\\n\\nMoreover, the order_by uses the item's keys. It's possible that the user could pass an invalid order_by_field, but that's handled by catching exceptions. Possible SQL injection-like attacks here would be limited to the existing data's keys, assuming that's controlled by the dataset, so maybe that's okay. Since the code uses x[order_by_field], which is safe as order_by_field is just a string. Unless the SQL query comes from an untrusted source and the dataset includes keys that could cause issues. But in Python, when you get an unknown key in a dict, it raises KeyError, which would be caught, so no code execution.\\n\\nThus, fixing the where clause handling should be sufficient.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the revised code should replace the eval part with the new parsed conditions and filter function.\\n\\nNow, write the corrected code.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":601,\"completion_tokens\":3538,\"total_tokens\":4139},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis says that using eval is insecure and suggests using ast.literal_eval instead. Wait, but literal_eval can only handle literals, right? The original code allows users to submit expressions, which might involve mathematical operations. So maybe ast.literal_eval isn't sufficient here. Hmm.\\n\\nWhat's the vulnerability here? Using eval allows arbitrary code execution. If the user inputs something like \\\"__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')\\\", that could be dangerous. So replacing eval with a safer alternative is crucial.\\n\\nBut how can I evaluate mathematical expressions safely? One approach could be to parse and evaluate the expression in a controlled way. Like using the operator module and a restricted set of operations. But that sounds complicated. Maybe using a safe evaluation library, like asteval or a custom parser?\\n\\nBut the user might want to compute expressions like \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\". Eval can do that, but it's unsafe. Maybe I can use a whitelist approach. Validate the input to only contain numbers and allowed operators. Like digits, +, -, *, /, etc. Then evaluate the sanitized expression.\\n\\nSo the plan is: sanitize the input to make sure it's only a mathematical expression with safe characters, then evaluate it. But writing a regex to do that. Let's think about possible valid characters: digits, ., +, -, *, /, %, spaces, maybe parentheses, ** for exponent (but in Python that's handled), but need to make sure there's no function calls or other dangerous stuff.\\n\\nAlternatively, parse the expression using ast.parse and check all nodes are allowed. But that requires processing the abstract syntax tree and allowing only specific nodes. This might be more secure but more complex.\\n\\nGiven that the task says \\\"basic logic or mathematical expressions\\\", perhaps the safe way is to create a restricted evaluator. Here's an example approach:\\n\\nUse the ast module to parse the expression into an AST, then walk through each node to ensure it's allowed. For mathematical expressions, allow numbers, basic operators (+, -, *, /, **), parentheses, and maybe variables if necessary, but the question says users submit expressions. Wait, but variables could be a problem. Wait, the original code uses eval(expr), so variables could be part of the input. But variables might not be allowed, but if the task allows it, this complicates things. However, allowing variables could lead to accessing built-ins. So perhaps the intended solution is to evaluate literal mathematical expressions without variables.\\n\\nIn that case, using literal_eval wouldn't work for expressions. literal_eval parses Python literals (like strings, numbers, lists, etc.) but doesn't evaluate expressions. For example, \\\"2 + 3\\\" is a syntax error for literal_eval because it's an expression, not a literal.\\n\\nHmm. So replacing eval with literal_eval here won't work if the input is an expression. That's the problem. So the original code uses eval, and the bandit report says to replace it, but doing so directly breaks functionality. So the user's code's intended functionality requires evaluating expressions, so we need a safer way than eval.\\n\\nThus, the solution needs to allow evaluating mathematical expressions safely.\\n\\nSo, one approach is to implement a calculator that parses the expression and evaluates it safely. But writing a parser from scratch is time-consuming. Alternatively, use a library or a restricted eval with a limited environment.\\n\\nLet's consider a safer approach: creating a namespace with only allowed functions. For example, override __builtins__ to None or provide a custom environment that has no dangerous functions. For example:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {'__builtins__': None}\\nallowed_locals = {}\\nresult = eval(expr, allowed_globals, allowed_locals)\\n\\nBut would that work? Wait, if __builtins__ is None, then any access to built-in functions would cause a NameError. So in this case, expressions like \\\"2 + 3\\\" would still work, because the operators are allowed, but functions like __import__ would not be available. But also, in practice, even with __builtins__ set to None, some malicious code can still be executed? Or maybe it's safer.\\n\\nWait, the Python documentation says that if __builtins__ is not present in the globals dictionary, the built-in module is available. But if __builtins__ is set to None, then maybe accessing built-in functions would raise an error.\\n\\nSo, perhaps using eval with a restricted environment. Here's an example of a safe approach for evaluating mathematical expressions.\\n\\nAnother idea: use a library like 'simpleeval' which is designed for safe evaluation of expressions. But the problem may require using standard libraries only.\\n\\nAlternatively, use a custom evaluator.\\n\\nBut the code needs to replace the use of eval. So perhaps the best approach is to use a restricted environment for eval.\\n\\nSo modifying the code:\\n\\ndef process_user_expression(expr: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        # Restrict the environment\\n        allowed_globals = {'__builtins__': None}\\n        allowed_locals = {}\\n        result = eval(expr, allowed_globals, allowed_locals)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Processing Failed!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut what if the user inputs \\\"2 + 3\\\"? This uses the operators, which are allowed, and would work. How about \\\"os\\\"? If the expression tries to access a variable like \\\"os\\\", since the allowed_globals and locals have nothing, and builtins are disabled, it would raise a NameError, returning \\\"Processing Failed\\\". So this might be safer.\\n\\nBut Bandit might still flag this because it's using eval. The original Bandit report recommended using ast.literal_eval, but that's only for literals. Since the original code evaluates expressions, not literals, we need an alternative approach.\\n\\nAnother solution: parse the expression with the ast module and check that the nodes are only allowed types (e.g., numbers, operators). For example, parse the expression into an AST and walk the tree to check that there are no function calls, attribute accesses, etc. How to do that.\\n\\nHere's a plan: parse the expression into an AST, then validate that it's a simple arithmetic expression. For example, only allow expressions composed of BinOp operations with numbers and the allowed operators.\\n\\nBut implementing this would involve traversing the AST and checking each node. So lets define a NodeTransformer or a NodeVisitor that checks for allowed node types.\\n\\nHere's some code that does that:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\nclass SafeEvaluator(ast.NodeVisitor):\\n    allowed_nodes = (ast.Expression, ast.BinOp, ast.UnaryOp, ast.Num, ast.Constant,\\n                     ast.Add, ast.Sub, ast.Mult, ast.Div, ast.Mod, ast.Pow, ast.USub)\\n    \\n    def generic_visit(self, node):\\n        if not isinstance(node, self.allowed_nodes):\\n            raise ValueError(f\\\"Disallowed node type: {type(node).__name__}\\\")\\n        super().generic_visit(node)\\n\\ndef safe_eval(expr: str):\\n    tree = ast.parse(expr, mode='eval')\\n    evaluator = SafeEvaluator()\\n    evaluator.visit(tree)\\n    # If allowed, evaluate the expression in a restricted environment\\n    return eval(expr, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n\\nBut this allows expressions like \\\"3 + 4 * 2\\\". Then, in the process_user_expression function, wrap it in a try block, use this safe_eval, and catch exceptions.\\n\\nSo integrating this into the original code:\\n\\nThe code would use safe_eval, which first parses the expression as an AST, checks if all nodes are allowed (only numbers and arithmetic operations), then evaluates the expression with a restricted environment.\\n\\nThis way, even if the string passes the AST checks, eval is called with no access to builtins or other modules.\\n\\nSo, combining these steps:\\n\\nImplement an AST checker followed by a safe eval.\\n\\nTherefore, modifying the original code as:\\n\\nBut in the user's code, they only have \\\"eval(expr)\\\", which uses the current environment, allowing arbitrary code execution.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\nAttempt to parse the user input into an abstract syntax tree as an expression. Walk the AST and ensure that all nodes are only arithmetic operations and numbers. Then evaluate in a restricted environment.\\n\\nThus, in the fixed code:\\n\\ndef process_user_expression(expr: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    import ast\\n\\n    class SafeVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):\\n        allowed = (ast.Expression, ast.BinOp, ast.UnaryOp, ast.Num, ast.Constant,\\n                   ast.Add, ast.Sub, ast.Mult, ast.Div, ast.Mod, ast.Pow, ast.USub)\\n        def generic_visit(self, node):\\n            if not isinstance(node, self.allowed):\\n                raise ValueError(\\\"Disallowed node\\\")\\n\\n    try:\\n        tree = ast.parse(expr, mode='eval')\\n        SafeVisitor().visit(tree)\\n        result = eval(expr, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except:\\n        return \\\"Processing Failed!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nThis would first parse the expression into an AST (mode 'eval' requires it to be an expression), then check the nodes. If any node is not allowed, it raises an error. Then evaluate it in a restricted environment without builtins.\\n\\nThis should mitigate code injection. Because even if the AST check passes, the eval is done with no access to any potentially dangerous functions.\\n\\nBut is this approach secure? For example, can someone inject code that still gets through this?\\n\\nWell, for example, if the expression is something like '(1).__class__', which is allowed if the AST checks allow attribute access. In the SafeVisitor above, attributes are not allowed (because the allowed nodes don't include ast.Attribute), so that would be caught. Therefore, parsing the AST to only allow certain node types.\\n\\nBut this code includes checking for Node types, which may inadvertently allow other nodes.\\n\\nAdditionally, in Python 3.8+, ast.Constant is used for all constants, but in earlier versions, there's ast.Num, ast.Str, etc. So to account for that, maybe check both. But to keep it simple, assuming that the current code uses a Python version that generates the correct nodes.\\n\\nIn the allowed list, they have ast.Constant and ast.Num (for legacy). But perhaps to handle Python versions, but the problem might not require that.\\n\\nThe visitor checks each node. So any node type not in the allowed list will raise an error.\\n\\nTherefore, this code should safely evaluate mathematical expressions without allowing function calls, imports, etc.\\n\\nNow, updating the original code to use this method instead of directly eval.\\n\\nSo the original code uses process_user_expression, and the Bandit analysis is fruitish|endoftext.\\n\\nThe corrected code should replace eval with this safe approach.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":309,\"completion_tokens\":2466,\"total_tokens\":2775},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis points out B605: using a shell process which can lead to injection. The problem here is using os.system with a command string that includes user inputs (folder and file_ext). If those variables have untrusted input, someone could inject malicious commands.\\n\\nLooking at the original code, they're constructing a command like \\\"rm folder/*.ext\\\" and executing it via os.system. Using shell commands with os.system is risky because of shell injection.\\n\\nThe solution is to avoid using the shell. Instead, use native Python functions to delete the files. So, instead of running an rm command, we can iterate through the files in the directory and delete them using Path.unlink().\\n\\nFirst, find all files in the specified folder with the given extension. Using the glob module to find the files seems right. Then, loop over each file and delete them one by one. Also, handle exceptions in case there's an error during deletion.\\n\\nLet me rewrite the function. Import pathlib and use Path(folder).glob to find all files matching *.file_ext. Then, loop over each file and try to unlink it. That way, there's no shell involved, so the injection risk is eliminated.\\n\\nWait, do I need to check if the folder exists again? Well, the original code checks if Path(folder).exists() before constructing the command. So we can keep that check. But even if the folder doesn't exist, as we're not using shell, maybe that's redundant, but the original code raises an error if the folder doesn't exist, so we'll leave that as is.\\n\\nRemove the command variable and os.system call. Instead, collect the list of files to delete. For each file in Path(folder).glob(f'*.{file_ext}'), check if it's a file (in case there's a directory with that extension), then unlink. Handle any exceptions during deletion and log errors.\\n\\nAlso, handle the logging: perhaps log each file being deleted, but the original code just logs the command. But the original function's purpose is to delete all files with that extension. So, after collecting all files, delete them in a loop.\\n\\nSo the revised code would do something like:\\n\\nfor file in Path(folder).glob(f'*.{file_ext}'):\\n    if file.is_file():\\n        try:\\n            file.unlink()\\n            logger.info(f\\\"Deleted {file}\\\")\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            logger.error(f\\\"Failed to delete {file}: {e}\\\")\\n            exit_code = 1  # or track some failure\\n\\nBut the original code had an exit_code based on the command's success. Now, we need to track if any deletion failed. So initialize exit_code as 0, and if any unlink fails, set exit_code to non-zero.\\n\\nAlternatively, catch OSError for each file and accumulate errors.\\n\\nBut maybe instead of os.system's exit code, the function can just return a boolean or keep track of success. But since the original code uses exit_code 0 for success and non-zero for failure, we need to replicate that.\\n\\nSo, in the loop, if any file deletion fails, log the error, and set exit_code to a non-zero value. Finally, if exit_code is 0, log success, else log failure.\\n\\nSo here's how:\\n\\nInitialize exit_code as 0.\\n\\nThen loop over each file matching the pattern:\\n\\nfor file_path in Path(folder).glob(f'*.{file_ext}'):\\n    try:\\n        file_path.unlink()\\n        logger.info(f\\\"Deleted {file_path}\\\")\\n    except OSError as e:\\n        logger.error(f\\\"Error deleting {file_path}: {e}\\\")\\n        exit_code = 1\\n\\nThat way, if any deletion fails, exit_code is set to 1. Then return or use that exit_code.\\n\\nIn the original code, it logs 'Files deleted successfully' if exit_code is 0. So the revised code would have similar logging.\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nChange the command part to the loop. So the fixed code removes the os.system call and replaces it with the loop.\\n\\nAlso, need to ensure that file_ext doesn't contain any path traversal. For example, if someone passes a file_ext like 'txt; somecommand', but in the original code, constructing *.file_ext could be a problem if file_ext includes certain characters. However, using glob with Path().glob() will treat the file_ext as a literal, and even if it has wildcards, glob will handle it as a pattern. Wait, if file_ext is 'py*', then it becomes *.py*, which would be * followed by .py anything. So if the code's intention is to remove only exactly the given extension, then the code should check that.\\n\\nWait, the original code uses os.path.join(folder, f'*.{file_ext}') and runs rm on that. So it's removing files in folder ending with .file_ext. The same intention can be replicated with Path(folder).glob(f'*.{file_ext}').\\n\\nBut if the file_ext is 'txt', then it's looking for all files ending with .txt. But if file_ext includes a slash or other special characters, the constructed pattern might not generate accurate results. But since the function's description says that the file_ext should be an extension, maybe it's assumed that the caller passes a valid extension without any path separators. So no, but better to sanitize file_ext.\\n\\nHowever, this is part of the problem. For example, the file_ext could be something like 'pdf; rm -rf /'. But in the original code, since they were building a shell command, that's dangerous. But once rewritten to use Path.glob, even if the file_ext is something malicious, the code might not be able to find the files so it might not delete, but it's better to properly sanitize.\\n\\nBut perhaps the original problem wasn't that. The primary issue here is removing the shell injection by avoiding the shell command. So even if the file_ext is 'txt;', the Path.glob in Python will treat the *.file_ext as a literal, but in reality, the Linux shell would have globbed it. Let me think.\\n\\nIf the original code intended to delete files in the folder named \\\".file_ext\\\", so if the file_ext is \\\"txt\\\", then the rm command deletes files ending with .txt. But if someone passes \\\"txt *\\\", then \\\"*.txt *\\\" would delete more files. But that's a problem if the file_ext can contain arbitrary characters.\\n\\nBut in the code's initial comments, it's supposed to take an extension, so maybe file_ext is expected to be a simple string like \\\"txt\\\", \\\"py\\\", etc. But to make sure that file_ext doesn't include any characters that would form a different pattern.\\n\\nBut the vulnerability here is using the shell to execute the command. The code is using os.system(\\\"rm ...\\\") which is vulnerable to shell injection if any of the parameters (folder or file_ext) include shell metacharacters. For example, if folder is \\\".; rm -rf /\\\", the constructed command might be \\\"rm .; rm -rf /*.ext\\\" which is dangerous.\\n\\nSo, by avoiding the shell and using Path.glob and then unlinking each file, we eliminate the shell injection. This is the correct approach.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code should use Path.glob and delete each file individually.\\n\\nPutting that all together, here's the fixed code:\\n\\n- Replace the command execution with a loop over files.\\n- Use pathlib to find and delete each file.\\n- Handle exceptions and set exit_code accordingly.\\n\\nThe logger messages should be updated to remove command running, but maybe keep the initial log message about deletion starting.\\n\\nSo here's the step-by-step:\\n\\n1. Check if the folder exists. Same as before.\\n2. Search for all files matching *.file_ext in folder.\\n3. Iterate over each file and unlink (delete) it.\\n4. Log each success or error.\\n5. Determine exit_code based on any failures.\\n\\nLet me write the corrected code.\\n\\nWait, the original code uses exit_code = os.system(command), then checks if it's 0. In the original code, os.system returns the exit status of the command. For rm, if any file is deleted, does it return 0 even if some files aren't found? Let's say in a shell, if you 'rm *.txt' and there are no txt files, rm returns an error. So in the original code, if there's no files to delete, the exit_code would be non-zero.\\n\\nBut in the fixed code, we need to decide whether an empty directory would result in a non-zero exit code. The original function may or may not consider that an error. Since in the fixed code, if there are no files to delete, the loop does nothing, exit_code remains 0, but maybe it should log that no files were found. But the original code doesn't check for that. Let's see: If there are no files matching, the rm command would return an error (unless the shell expansion doesn't find any matches and the command becomes 'rm' with no arguments, which would return an error. Wait, but in the shell command, when doing 'rm *.ext', if no files are found, depending on the shell settings, the glob may not expand. Oh right, by default, in bash, if a glob doesn't match any files, it's left as-is. So 'rm *.ext' becomes 'rm *.ext', and rm will throw an error: 'rm: cannot remove '*.ext': No such file or directory'. Hence, in that case, exit_code would be non-zero. So the original code considers the scenario where no files found as a failure, which may not be intended. But perhaps that's part of the function's design. The current code runs the command regardless. \\n\\nIn the fixed code, if no files are found, the code would proceed without deleting, and exit_code remains 0, which is perhaps different from the original behavior. But in reality, maybe the user should decide if that's an error. However, this discrepancy between original and fixed code needs to be addressed.\\n\\nWait, if we really want to mimic the original behavior (where if there are no files, the rm command returns non-zero and logs failure), then the fixed code may need to check if any files were deleted. Because in the fixed code's approach, if there are no files, exit_code would be 0, which would log success.\\n\\nTo handle this, perhaps after processing the files, if no files were found, we check if that's considered a success or failure. But in the original code, absence of files (thus exit_code !=0), the code would log a failure. Let me test:\\n\\nIf I have a folder with no .txt files, and execute 'rm *.txt', then the shell (if nullglob is not set) would generate 'rm *.txt', and rm would fail because *.txt matches nothing. Hence, in the original code, exit_code would be non-zero, leading to an error log.\\n\\nIn the fixed code, using Path().glob, when there are no files, the loop does nothing, exit_code is 0. So files not existing is considered a success. That's a different behavior. But perhaps the original code's behavior is not desired. Maybe the intended behavior of the function is to consider deleting files even if none were found as a success, which would make the original code incorrect. But how does the user expect the function to behave?\\n\\nSince the code is supposed to delete \\\"all files with the specified extension\\\", if none exist, perhaps it's supposed to succeed, not fail. But the original code, because it uses 'rm *.ext' in the shell, when no files match, returns an error. That's unintended, I suppose.\\n\\nThus, the original code may have a separate bug where the function fails when there's nothing to delete. The fixed code would address that by considering an empty result as a success. If the user wants to treat no files as an error, the code needs to check that. However, that's an existing behavior in the original code. But given that the original code's Bandit issue is security-focused, we may need to fix the security vulnerability regardless, but possibly introduce a change in exit_code behavior. However, since the problem description says to fix the reported vulnerabilities, we can proceed to fix the security issue, which may require adjusting the exit_code logic.\\n\\nSo, to handle the scenario where no files are found, and in that case, log a warning or something, but that's outside the scope of the problem here. The main task is to fix the injection vulnerability.\\n\\nThus, the corrected code would use os-native file operations instead of shell commands. So proceeding.\\n\\nHere's the corrected code:\\n\\ndef remove_files(folder: str, file_ext: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Deletes all files with the specified extension in the given directory.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Deleting files with extension '%s' in folder '%s'...\\\", file_ext, folder)\\n\\n    folder_path = Path(folder)\\n    if not folder_path.exists():\\n        logger.error(\\\"The folder '%s' does not exist.\\\", folder)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"The folder '{folder}' does not exist.\\\")\\n    \\n    exit_code = 0\\n    for file_path in folder_path.glob(f'*.{file_ext}'):\\n        if file_path.is_file():\\n            try:\\n                file_path.unlink()\\n                logger.info(\\\"Deleted file: %s\\\", file_path)\\n            except OSError as e:\\n                logger.error(\\\"Failed to delete file %s: %s\\\", file_path, e)\\n                exit_code = 1\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Files deleted successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to delete one or more files.\\\")\\n    return exit_code\\n\\nWait, but the original function doesn't return anything, but uses the exit_code to check. The original code uses os.system, whose exit code is collected, then logs success or failure. The corrected code should behave similarly. The os.system call returns the exit code of the shell command.\\n\\nIn the fixed code, we simulate that: if any file deletion failed, exit_code is 1 (multiple errors could be possible, but in my example it's setting exit_code to 1 on any failure). \\n\\nBut perhaps in the original code, if the rm command fails, the exit_code is non-zero. So the fix's logic is that if all deletions are successful, exit_code is 0, else 1.\\n\\nNote: If there are multiple files, and some deletes fail, exit_code will be 1 (only the first error sets it to 1). That might be sufficient for the purpose of the function.\\n\\nThis fixes the shell injection vulnerability by not using os.system and instead using Path's glob and unlink methods.\\n\\nSo the new code removes the command string and shell usage entirely. Thus, the B605 issue is resolved.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":430,\"completion_tokens\":3363,\"total_tokens\":3793},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

I need to fix this code that deserializes data but uses pickle which is unsafe. The Bandit report pointed out that using pickle can be a security risk because it can execute arbitrary code during deserialization, right?\\n\\nSo the original function has options for json, yaml, and pickle. The vulnerability is in the pickle part. The user mentioned that the data comes from an untrusted party, which makes it even more dangerous to use pickle here.\\n\\nThe task says to provide a list of trusted signatures. Wait, maybe the function should only allow certain formats. Like if the user only trusts json and yaml but not pickle, then we should remove pickle support. But the original code includes it, but the comments say to provide trusted ones. Oh, the problem statement instructs to make a fixed version by handling trusted signatures.\\n\\nFirst step: Remove the pickle handling entirely. Since using pickle is unsafe when dealing with untrusted data, the safest approach is to disallow it. So in the deserialize_data function, if the signature is pickle, raise an error instead of processing it. Because even if someone specifies 'pickle' as the signature, allowing it poses a risk.\\n\\nLooking at the current code, there's an 'elif signature == \\\"pickle\\\"' block which imports pickle and uses loads. That's where the vulnerabilities are. So instead of handling 'pickle', we should remove that case. But wait, maybe the function should only allow certain trusted formats. The comment says \\\"provide a list of trusted signatures in your code\\\". So maybe the function should check if the given signature is in a list of trusted ones.\\n\\nWait, the original problem description says: \\\"You need to provide a list of trusted signature in your code.\\\" So perhaps the trusted formats are those that are considered safe. So json and yaml (assuming safe_load is used for YAML) might be acceptable, but pickle is not. So the fixed code should only allow the trusted ones, like json and yaml, and disallow pickle.\\n\\nWait, the original code uses yaml.safe_load, which is the safe way. For json.loads, it's generally safe. But pickle is unsafe, so the fix is to remove support for pickle, thereby preventing its use.\\n\\nBut the user's function currently supports pickle. So maybe the issue is that the code allows pickle even though it shouldn't. So the fix is to remove the 'pickle' case. That way, if someone tries to use it, it raises an error in the else clause.\\n\\nBut how does the code handle if 'signature' is 'pickle'? In the original code, it's processed. So to fix, we need to delete the elif block for pickle and maybe raise an error if the format is not in the trusted list.\\n\\nAlternatively, even better: instead of checking for 'json', 'yaml', etc., first define a list of trusted formats (like ['json', 'yaml']), and check if the provided signature is not in that list. Then, for each supported format, proceed.\\n\\nWait, in the original code, the user can pass any signature, like 'json', 'yaml', 'pickle', and others. The problem is that including 'pickle' is unsafe. So to make the code secure, the trusted signatures should exclude 'pickle'. Hence, the 'pickle' case should be removed, causing any attempt to use it to trigger the else clause and raise a ValueError.\\n\\nBut in the current code, 'pickle' is handled, leading to the Bandit warnings. So, the solution is to remove the 'elif signature == \\\"pickle\\\"' block. Then, any user trying to deserialize with 'pickle' will hit the else clause and get an error.\\n\\nLet me verify. After removing the pickle part:\\n\\ndef deserialize_data(data, signature=\\\"json\\\"):\\n    if signature == \\\"json\\\":\\n        import json\\n        return json.loads(data)\\n    elif signature == \\\"yaml\\\":\\n        import yaml\\n        return yaml.safe_load(data)\\n    else:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported format: {signature}\\\")\\n\\nBut wait, the problem's original code mentions that the data comes from an untrusted party, so maybe even json and yaml could have issues. Wait, no. For json, json.loads is safe because it doesn't execute arbitrary code. For YAML, using safe_load is considered safe because it doesn't load arbitrary classes. So the existing code's YAML case uses safe_load, which is correct. So those two are okay.\\n\\nBut the pickle part is the only one that's vulnerable. So by removing the pickle case, we eliminate the vulnerability.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would no longer support pickle, thereby preventing its unsafe usage.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code deletes the pickle handling. That way, if someone passes 'pickle' as the signature, it falls to the else block and throws an error, and thus Bandit won't flag it because there's no import or use of pickle anymore.\\n\\nSo the answer is to remove the code that handles 'pickle' signatures.\\n\\nWait the original code included 'pickle' as a possible signature. But after fixing, it should not.\\n\\nSo the correct code is to comment out or delete the 'elif signature == \\\"pickle\\\"' part. Let me check the Bandit analysis results. The warnings are in lines 12 and 13 regarding importing pickle and using its loads method.\\n\\nSo removing those lines would fix the issues.\\n\\nYes, that makes sense.\\n\\nFinal fixed code:\\n\\ndef deserialize_data(data, signature=\\\"json\\\"):\\n    if signature == \\\"json\\\":\\n        import json\\n        return json.loads(data)\\n    elif signature == \\\"yaml\\\":\\n        import yaml\\n        return yaml.safe_load(data)\\n    else:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported format: {signature}\\\")\\n\\nThat's the code without any pickle handling, thus not using the insecure module. Also, we can check that the error message uses {signature} instead of {format}, as there was a typo in the original code's exception.\\n\\nWait, original code uses:\\n\\nraise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported format: {format}\\\")\\n\\nBut 'format' is a built-in function. That's a bug. Because in the code provided, the variable 'format' is not defined. It should be {signature} instead. Because in the code, the argument is 'signature', not 'format'. So looking back:\\n\\nOriginal code's raise line:\\n\\nraise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported format: {format}\\\")\\n\\nThis is an error. It should be raising with signature. For example, signature is the parameter.\\n\\nYes, so in the original code, there's a typo. 'format' is a variable that's not defined. Instead, it should be 'signature' that is checked. So the error message should raise with signature's value.\\n\\nSo even in the original code, that line has a NameError bug because 'format' isn't defined. The code uses 'signature', so the error message should refer to {signature}.\\n\\nTherefore, in the fixed code, this is corrected to use {signature}, so in the else: raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported format: {signature}\\\")\\n\\nSo to summarize, the fixes are:\\n\\n1. Remove the 'pickle' case (the entire elif block for 'pickle'), which eliminates the unsafe use of pickle module.\\n\\n2. Fix the error message in the else clause to use {signature} instead of {format}.\\n\\nThese changes address the Bandit security warnings and correct the bug in the error message.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":501,\"completion_tokens\":1642,\"total_tokens\":2143},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis points out a possible injection issue because the command is built by string formatting. Let me look at the original code.\\n\\nThe function archive_logs uses os.system to run a zip command. The command is built by f\\\"zip -r {archive_path} {log_directory}\\\". Oh right, using user-supplied paths here could be dangerous if they have spaces or special characters. Plus, shell injection is a risk if the directory names aren't sanitized.\\n\\nSo how to fix this? Using the subprocess module instead of os.system is better. Specifically, subprocess.run with a list of arguments to avoid the shell. That way, each argument is passed correctly without the shell interpreting them.\\n\\nWait, zip might need to be called with the paths. So in the original command, -r is for recursive, and then archive_path and log_directory. But when using subprocess, we need to split into parts. Let's create a list like ['zip', '-r', str(archive_path), log_directory]. But wait, log_directory is a directory, so maybe we should list the contents properly. Alternatively, maybe creating the archive in a safer way, but using subprocess properly.\\n\\nAnother thought: maybe using Python's built-in zipfile module would be more secure and avoid shell entirely. But if they specifically need to use the zip command, perhaps for efficiency or features, then subprocess is the way.\\n\\nSo replacing os.system with subprocess.run. Also, avoiding shell=True. Let's construct the command as a list instead of a single string. That prevents shell injection because each argument is passed directly.\\n\\nIn the original code, command is f\\\"zip -r {archive_path} {log_directory}\\\". If log_directory has spaces, the shell would split it, but when using subprocess without a shell, we need to handle the arguments properly. But in this case, log_directory is a single directory path. So passing it as one argument should be okay.\\n\\nWait, using subprocess.run(['zip', '-r', archive_path, log_directory], ...). But archive_path is a Path object, which might need to be converted to a string. So str(archive_path).\\n\\nThen check the exit code. In subprocess, check returncode attribute. Also, maybe capture any output if needed, but in this case, maybe let it output as usual.\\n\\nSo the fixed code should look like this:\\n\\nUsing subprocess.run with shell=False, passing the command as a list.\\n\\nBut need to handle exceptions too? Maybe check if zip is available. But the original code just checks the exit code. So in the new code, we can run subprocess.run and capture the return code.\\n\\nSo replacing exit_code = os.system(command) with something like:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run(['zip', '-r', str(archive_path), log_directory], capture_output=True, text=True)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nWait, but wait: the original code's os.system uses the shell, which might affect how paths are expanded. But when using shell=False, the arguments are passed directly to zip. So if log_directory is a string path that's valid, it should work.\\n\\nBut let me make sure: the original command used -r to recursively zip the log_directory. So zip -r [archive] [dir] would zip the contents of [dir]. So when run via subprocess as a list, that should be correct.\\n\\nAdditionally, need to import subprocess.\\n\\nWait, the original code might have imported os, but subprocess is needed here. So adding import subprocess at the top. But the user might have included that; but the provided code snippet just shows the function, so we have to ensure that in the fixed code, subprocess is imported.\\n\\nBut the original code's imports are not shown. Since they used os.system, they probably have import os. For subprocess, the code needs to import it. But in the answer, maybe the original code has all necessary imports? The user didn't include them, but when providing the fixed code, perhaps adding the necessary import.\\n\\nWait, the original code starts with 'import os'? Let's check the snippet. The given code snippet in the problem includes this:\\n\\nThe code starts with: def archive_logs(log_directory: str, destination_directory: str):\\n\\nBut there's a logger.info, so maybe they have a logger imported, and paths from Path, so from pathlib import Path. Also, os module is used. The user code may or may not import subprocess already. However, in the original code, os.system is used, so to switch to subprocess, we need to import it.\\n\\nBut when writing the fixed code, we should add import subprocess if it's needed, but maybe the code didn't have that. So, to make the fixed code complete, but I'll check the code as presented.\\n\\nThe original function uses os.system, so the code must have imported os. For the fix, switching to subprocess, so the correct code would need to import subprocess.\\n\\nBut the user hasn't provided the entire code, only the function. So when writing the fixed version, we can assume that necessary modules are imported. However, in the original code, subprocess wasn't used, so in the fixed code, an import statement might be missing.\\n\\nBut the user says to provide the corrected version of the code. The user probably has all the necessary imports except for subprocess.\\n\\nSo the fixed code should include importing subprocess. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the code starts with:\\n\\ndef archive_logs(...):\\n\\nNo imports shown, but in the code, logger.info is used, so the actual code probably has the correct imports. When the user provides the code to fix, perhaps the imports are there. But in the code provided in the problem, the start is after the initial comment.\\n\\nBut looking at the original code:\\n\\nThe code defines the function. Inside, they use os.path.isdir, os.system, Path, etc. So there should be imports of os, pathlib.Path, and logging (for logger). But in the fixed code, when using subprocess, we need to include that import.\\n\\nSo the user's problem may expect adding 'import subprocess' to the code. But in the given code snippet provided in the problem, it's not present. Therefore, in the fixed code, we need to add that import.\\n\\nWait, but the problem says: \\\"provide the corrected version of the code.\\\" The original code snippet may not have the necessary import, so including it is important. Since the user provided the function and not full code, possibly without all imports, but in the correct code, the missing import needs to be added.\\n\\nSo, the updated function must use subprocess, which requires importing it. So the fixed code should import subprocess if not already present.\\n\\nBut in the problem, the original code may not have included it. However, the user's original code might not have included all necessary imports, but when showing the code, only the function is given. Therefore, when fixing the code, assuming that subprocess is imported. But without seeing the original imports, I have to make a correct assumption.\\n\\nSo in the corrected code, where is the import statement to be placed? The original code probably had:\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport logging\\n\\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\n\\nSo in the fixed code, adding import subprocess.\\n\\nIf the original code didn't have that, then the fixed code should include it. Therefore, to ensure the code is correct, the import subprocess statement should be present.\\n\\nHowever, in the problem's vulnerable code, the function is given. Therefore, the correct code may need to import subprocess. So, in the solution, here's the steps:\\n\\n1. Replace os.system(command) with subprocess.run(..., shell=False).\\n\\nBut the command is built as a list. So the corrected lines would be:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\n\\n...\\n\\ncommand = ['zip', '-r', str(archive_path), log_directory]\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode\\n\\nBut also handle potential errors, like checking if the command exists.\\n\\nBut in the original code, even if the command fails, they just log an error. So using subprocess will replicate that.\\n\\nSo in code:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command).returncode\\n\\nAlso, ensure that str(archive_path) is used, since Path object might otherwise cause an error.\\n\\nOriginal line: archive_path = Path(destination_directory) / \\\"logs_backup.zip\\\"\\n\\nThus, when constructing the command, we need to convert it to a string.\\n\\nSo, assemble the list as ['zip', '-r', str(archive_path), log_directory]\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code will use:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(['zip', '-r', str(archive_path), log_directory]).returncode\\n\\nNo shell involved.\\n\\nTherefore, the code no longer uses a shell, so preventing command injection.\\n\\nNow, putting that into the function.\\n\\nAlso, verify that subprocess is imported. So adding import subprocess at the top of the code if it's not already there. But according to the problem's code snippet, the user's code starts directly with 'def archive_logs...', so the imports are not shown. However, when providing the fixed code, you should include necessary imports that are required.\\n\\nWait, the original code uses os.system and os.path.isdir, so import os is there. Path is from pathlib, so from pathlib import Path. But subprocess is not imported, so the fixed code must import it.\\n\\nTherefore, in the corrected code, the imports would include:\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport subprocess\\nimport logging  # assuming they have the logger from logging.\\n\\nBut the original code may already have some of these. However, since the user provided only the function, maybe all the imports are outside. But to properly fix the code, the correction would include the necessary import of subprocess.\\n\\nBut according to the problem's instruction, the code should be provided in a single snippet.\\n\\nSo putting all this together, the fixed code would look like:\\n\\nBut the question says: \\\"Your response should only include the code, do not output anything else!!!\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, the answer must be the complete corrected code.\\n\\nOriginal code has the following parts:\\n\\ndef archive_logs(log_directory: str, destination_directory: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Backs up log files...\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Backing up logs...\\\")\\n    if directory checks...\\n\\nSo the fixed code would replace the os.system calls with subprocess.run.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct function code would be as follows:\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport subprocess\\nimport logging\\n\\ndef archive_logs(log_directory: str, destination_directory: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Backs up log files by compressing them into a zip archive and storing them in a backup directory.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # assuming logger is properly configured, possibly the original code had this\\n    logger.info(\\\"Backing up logs...\\\")\\n    if not os.path.isdir(log_directory):\\n        logger.error(f\\\"Logs directory '{log_directory}' does not exist.\\\")\\n        return\\n\\n    if not os.path.isdir(destination_directory):\\n        logger.error(f\\\"Backup directory '{destination_directory}' does not exist.\\\")\\n        return\\n    archive_path = Path(destination_directory) / \\\"logs_backup.zip\\\"\\n    command = ['zip', '-r', str(archive_path), log_directory]\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", ' '.join(command))\\n    result = subprocess.run(command)\\n    exit_code = result.returncode\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Logs backed up successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to back up logs; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n\\nBut wait, the original code uses os.path.isdir; that's still there. The main change is constructing the command as a list, using subprocess.run(command), and capturing the return code.\\n\\nBut in the problem's code, the exit_code is assigned via os.system, which we replace with subprocess's returncode.\\n\\nNow, a few points:\\n\\n1. Did the command need to change in any other way? For example, log_directory is passed as is. If log_directory has spaces, when passed via the list, subprocess will quote it appropriately. So splitting into the list elements correctly handles spaces.\\n\\nBut since log_directory is a path that the code has already checked is a directory, passing it as a single argument to zip should correctly add the entire directory.\\n\\nThus, the code should work.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps when using the zip command, providing the directory path would recursively add all files in it.\\n\\nSo yes, the fix should be to replace the command with a list, run via subprocess without shell=True.\\n\\nAlso, remove the shell and avoid the shell_ injection.\\n\\nSo the main changes are:\\n\\n- Use subprocess.run instead of os.system.\\n\\n- Split the command into a list of arguments, each as separate elements.\\n\\nSo, the corrected code is as above.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":459,\"completion_tokens\":2963,\"total_tokens\":3422},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

Bandit's analysis pointed out that the standard pseudo-random generators aren't secure for cryptographic purposes. So, the main problem here is using the random module, which isn't suitable for security-related tasks like generating passwords.\\n\\nFirst, I should replace the random module with a more secure alternative. In Python, the 'secrets' module is designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data like passwords. So I should switch from using random.choices to secrets.choice.\\n\\nWait, but random.choices allows selecting k elements, right? But secrets module doesn't have a choices function. So I need to generate each character one by one. Like, loop for the password length, each time picking a character from the characters list using secrets.choice.\\n\\nSo the line return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=pw_length)) would need to be replaced with a comprehension that uses secrets.choice in a loop.\\n\\nAlso, I need to import the secrets module instead of random. So I remove the import random and add import secrets. Also, don't forget the import string since the code must be using string.ascii_letters and others.\\n\\nWait the original code has 'import random' inside the function? That's not good practice but might still work. However, in the fixed code, I should import secrets and string at the top, but maybe the original code didn't import string? Wait the original code uses string.ascii_letters etc., so that code must have an 'import string' somewhere. Wait the original code as written here, in the code snippet, in line10, uses 'string.ascii_letters' etc. So the original code is missing an 'import string'! Wait, but maybe that's an omission in the code provided? Because without importing the string module, the code would throw a NameError.\\n\\nWait, the original code in the problem seems like a function. Let me check the code again:\\n\\nYes, in the code provided:\\n\\ndef make_password(pw_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG used to generate password (vulnerable code)\\n    import random\\n    if pw_length \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Password length must be at least 8 characters.\\\")\\n    \\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=pw_length))\\n\\nBut wait, where is the import for 'string'? Oh, right, the code might have missed including the 'import string' line. Because in that code, 'string' is used but not imported. So the problem's code has a bug where 'string' is not imported. Wait that's possible, or perhaps the code actually has an import, but it's not in the provided snippet?\\n\\nBut as per the code given here, there's an error— the function uses 'string.ascii_letters', etc., but the code doesn't import the string module. So that's another problem. So in the fixed code, I need to add an import string statement.\\n\\nSo, the code is broken in two ways: first, the standard PRNG is used, and second, it's missing import string.\\n\\nBut according to the user's Bandit analysis, the issue is B311, which is about using random. So the user is expected to fix the PRNG problem, but in the original code, there might be an import string missing, which causes it to not run. Let me check the code again.\\n\\nLooking at the code:\\n\\nAfter 'import random', the code is:\\n\\ncharacters = string.ascii_letters ... \\n\\nBut that would cause a NameError for 'string'. Therefore, the original code is incorrect. But the Bandit analysis result's code snippet does have the line: Location: .\\\\data/SecCodePLT/... line 10 and 11. Line 10: 'characters = ...'\\n\\nThe Bandit analysis mentions line11:random.choices(...). But according to the code as pasted, the original code doesn't have an import string. So that's a problem. So perhaps in the actual code the 'string' module is imported outside the function?\\n\\nWait, in the given code, the string is not imported. So the function make_password as written would throw a NameError: name 'string' is not defined. So that's an error in the original code.\\n\\nBut perhaps the user intended to include the 'import string' in the code? Maybe it's missing because of a formatting issue. Or maybe the code is from a bigger context where the string was imported. Hmm. Oh well, to fix the code correctly, perhaps in addition to replacing the PRNG, we need to import string.\\n\\nSo, fixing the code requires three steps:\\n\\n1. Replace the use of random.choices with a secure method using secrets module.\\n\\n2. Import the string module to use string.ascii_letters, etc.\\n\\nAlso, import secrets instead of random.\\n\\n3. And adjust the code structure accordingly.\\n\\nSo, in the fixed code, I need to import string and secrets.\\n\\nLooking at the original code:\\n\\nInside the function, they import random. Wait, but importing modules inside a function is allowed but not best practice.\\n\\nBut in the corrected code, perhaps we can import the necessary modules outside the function.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would start with imports:\\n\\nimport string\\n\\nimport secrets\\n\\nBut let's see.\\n\\nSo the steps for correction:\\n\\n- Remove the import random line inside the function.\\n\\n- Add 'import secrets' and 'import string' outside the function.\\n\\nThen generate each character by looping pw_length times, selecting a character using secrets.choice.\\n\\nWait, 'secrets' has the 'choice' method but not 'choices' like 'random' module. So, the old code uses random.choices with 'k=pw_length', which is a list of pw_length elements. To replicate that securely, you have to make a loop.\\n\\nSo, for example:\\n\\ncharacters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n\\npassword = ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(pw_length))\\n\\nThat should generate a password securely.\\n\\nPutting it all together.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would be:\\n\\ndef make_password(pw_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import string\\n    import secrets\\n    if pw_length \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Password length must be at least 8 characters.\\\")\\n    \\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(pw_length))\\n\\nWait, but importing modules inside a function is possible but not best practice. It's better to import at the top. But perhaps the original code's issue wasn't that. The problem was PRNG.\\n\\nSo, the corrected code should first import the necessary modules. Let's adjust:\\n\\nBut the original code had 'import random' inside the function. So perhaps they wanted to have the function-contained imports? Well, that's an anti-pattern, but to follow that style, maybe the fixed code would have 'import secrets' inside the function.\\n\\nBut no, importing inside the function every time it's called is unnecessary. So better to have the imports at the top.\\n\\nBut regardless, perhaps the code needs:\\n\\ndef make_password(pw_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    if pw_length \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Password length must be at least 8 characters.\\\")\\n    \\n    import string\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    import secrets\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(pw_length))\\n\\nWait, but it's not proper to import inside the function. So to fix that, the code should have the imports at the top:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef make_password(pw_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    if pw_length \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(...)\\n    \\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + ... \\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for ... )\\n\\nBut the original code is written with perhaps a missing import for string. Ohh. Wait, in the original code:\\n\\nAfter the function definition, in line 6: import random. Then line 10: characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation.\\n\\nBut the 'string' module hasn't been imported. So the original code would crash. Therefore, the code is missing 'import string'.\\n\\nThus, the fixed code must include 'import string'.\\n\\nPutting this together.\\n\\nSo corrected code should:\\n\\n- Import string and secrets at the top.\\n\\n- Generate the characters as before.\\n\\n- Use secrets.choice in a loop to select each character.\\n\\nThus, the fixed code is as follows:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef make_password(pw_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    if pw_length \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Password length must be at least 8 characters.\\\")\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(pw_length))\\n\\nThat's correct.

Wait, is SystemRandom in the secrets module or is it in random?\\n\\nWait, secrets is a separate module. The SystemRandom class is in random, actually. So maybe another approach. Alternatively, the secrets module has token_hex, but that only gives hex digits. Or token_urlsafe, which uses base64 encoding but might include dashes and underscores.\\n\\nThe original code uses letters and digits, which is 62 characters. So using secrets module might not have a direct method. So maybe the approach is to use the SystemRandom class from the random module, which is based on os.urandom. But wait, the problem with the original code was using random, which is not secure. Instead, using secrets.choice in a loop. So for each character in the key, use secrets.choice to pick from the chars string. So that would generate each character securely.\\n\\nSo the steps would be:\\n\\n1. Replace import random with import secrets and string.\\n2. Instead of random.choices(chars, k=key_length), generate each character by calling secrets.choice(chars) in a loop key_length times.\\n\\nLet me check how that would work. Original code:\\n\\nreturn ''.join(random.choices(chars, k=key_length))\\n\\nRevised code:\\n\\nreturn ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(key_length))\\n\\nThat would make each character selection using a cryptographically secure method. That should resolve the B311 issue mentioned by Bandit.\\n\\nSo in the fixed code, substitute random.choices with secrets.choice and a list comprehension or generator expression. Let me test that.\\n\\nAlso, need to make sure the secrets module is imported. The original code does 'import random'. So in the function, replace that with 'import secrets' and 'import string'.\\n\\nWait, but the original code was:\\n\\ndef produce_unique_key(...):\\n    import random\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    ...\\n\\nBut string isn't imported yet. Wait, the original code might have 'import string' implicitly? Because they use string.ascii_letters and string.digits, which would require the string module to be imported.\\n\\nOh, in the code given, there's an 'import random' inside the function. But there's no import string. Wait that was an error. Wait in the original code snippet, lines 7 and 8:\\n\\nVulnerable Code:\\n...\\n    import random\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(chars, k=key_length))\\n\\nBut where is 'string' imported? The code would actually throw a NameError because 'string' is not imported. Wait, that's a mistake in the original code. Maybe the intended code has an import string outside. But the user-provided code has an import random inside the function. So either way, it's a missing import. So that's another issue. Wait, the code provided in the problem might not be entirely correct. Because the Function starts with 'def produce_unique_key...', then inside the function, there's an 'import random'. But then 'chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits' implies that the 'string' module is imported, but there's no import statement for it. So the code as written would crash due to missing string module. So the user may have a mistake here. But perhaps in reality, the code has 'import string' at the top but that wasn't shown. Or maybe the code author forgot. So to make the code work, need to import string as well.\\n\\nTherefore, in the corrected code, the function should import string, and use secrets instead of random. But wait, if we put the correct code, first, to import string at the top (even inside the function), but the original code probably intended to have that. Wait, the original code's line 7 is 'chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits', so for that to work, there must be an 'import string' somewhere. But as per the code given, the only import is 'import random', so that line would fail. So perhaps the original code had an import string at the module level missing here.\\n\\nAssuming that the code is written with the necessary imports. But since the user's problem comes with Bandit's error, perhaps we can fix it properly regardless. So, fixing two errors: using a weak PRNG, and possibly missing imports.\\n\\nSo, to fix:\\n\\n1. Replace random.choices with a secure method.\\n\\nOriginal code inside function:\\n\\nimport random\\nchars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\nreturn ''.join(random.choices(chars, k=key_length))\\n\\nBut the string is from the string module. So add 'import string' at the top. Wait, but in the original code, the function has an import for random. It probably needs to import string.\\n\\nWait the entire code as provided:\\n\\ndef produce_unique_key(...):\\n    import random\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ...\\n\\nThis would crash because 'string' is not imported. So to fix that, import string as well.\\n\\nBut perhaps the user intended that but missed including the import in the code. So in the corrected code, we need to add 'import string' inside the function, or at the top. Let me check the function code again.\\n\\nThe function may not have imported string. So even the original code has a missing import. Therefore, in the corrected version, we need to add that.\\n\\nTherefore, code correction steps:\\n\\n1. Add import string.\\n\\n2. Replace random.choices with secure method.\\n\\nOriginal code has a possible crash because 'string' is not imported. So, likely the original code has a mistake. So the corrected code should include the required imports.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would be:\\n\\ndef produce_unique_key(key_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import secrets\\n    import string\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(key_length))\\n\\nThat way, the code imports secrets instead of random, and string is imported.\\n\\nWait, but wait returns also the code to have the function. So the secrets module must be used correctly.\\n\\nYes, and the code would then generate each character using secrets.choice, which is cryptographically secure.\\n\\nSo the corrected code:\\n\\ndef produce_unique_key(key_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import secrets\\n    import string\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(key_length))\\n\\nThis avoids using random.choices, and uses secrets.choice instead. The Bandit tool would now not detect B311 since secrets is considered secure.\\n\\nIn this fixed code, the only changes are:\\n\\n- Replaced 'import random' with 'import secrets' and 'import string'.\\n- Changed random.choices(...) to using a generator expression with secrets.choice(chars) in a loop.\\n\\nThat should resolve the vulnerability.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":326,\"completion_tokens\":1720,\"total_tokens\":2046},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis pointed out that using random isn't safe for security purposes. So, first, I remember that in Python, the 'random' module isn't cryptographically secure. Instead, for security-sensitive tokens, we should use the 'secrets' module.\\n\\nLooking at the original code: they import random and use random.choices. The function creates a token by joining characters selected from chars. The issue is definitely the use of random here. So the fix would involve replacing random.choices with something from the secrets module.\\n\\nWait, the secrets module has functions like choice, but not exactly a choices method. Oh, right, for generating a string with k characters, maybe we can loop k times using secrets.choice each time. Or maybe use secrets.token_urlsafe or something similar, but that might not give the exact characters specified (like letters and digits).\\n\\nThe original function allows specifying the size and uses the combination of ASCII letters and digits. The chars variable is string.ascii_letters + string.digits. So using secrets.choice in a list comprehension for each character would be better.\\n\\nLet me adjust the code: replace random with secrets. So import secrets instead, then instead of random.choices, do [secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(size)] and then join that.\\n\\nWait, but the original uses random.choices with k=size, which selects size elements with replacement (which is allowed). Using secrets.choice in a loop should be equivalent but more secure.\\n\\nAnother point: Make sure that 'string' is imported, since in the original code, they have 'chars = string.ascii_letters...' but the original code may have an 'import string' statement. Wait, looking back, the original code has the line 'import random' inside the function. Oh wait, in the for the code, in the vulnerable code's function:\\n\\ndef create_secure_token(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG for generating identifiers\\n    import random\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(chars, k=size))\\n\\nWait, there's an import inside the function. So 'string' isn't imported here. Wait, actually, that's another potential problem. Because 'string' isn't imported in the code snippet. That would cause a NameError. Wait, the code probably has an import statement missing. Because in the code, they have 'string.ascii_letters' but the code doesn't import string. Oh, right! That's an error. But since the original code is provided as a snippet, perhaps there was a missing import. But according to the code given in the question, the code as written would produce a NameError when it tries to reference 'string.ascii_letters'.\\n\\nHmm. So in the corrected code, I need to add an import for string as well. Let's look again:\\n\\nThe vulnerable code includes 'import random' inside the function, then uses 'string.ascii_letters'. But string isn't imported. So that's actually a bug. But that wasn't part of the Bandit's findings, so perhaps it's a typo and the original code had an import of string elsewhere.\\n\\nWait, but looking at the code:\\n\\nThe function is defined as:\\n\\ndef create_secure_token(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG for generating identifiers\\n    import random\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(chars, k=size))\\n\\nIn this code, unless there's a global import for string, this would cause a NameError. But in any case, for the code to work, it needs to import the string module. So the corrected code should include that.\\n\\nSo the initial code is missing an import statement for 'string'.\\n\\nSo, to fix the original code, two things are needed:\\n\\n1. Replace random with secrets module since secrets is cryptographically secure.\\n\\n2. Import the string module so that string.ascii_letters and string.digits are accessible.\\n\\nMoreover, when switching from random.choices to secrets, we can't directly use choices because secrets doesn't have a choices function. Instead, generate each character by selecting one at a time using secrets.choice.\\n\\nSo, putting all together:\\n\\nImporting string and using secrets.choice for each character.\\n\\nInside the function, perhaps:\\n\\nBut first, we need to import secrets. Instead of importing random, use secrets. However, the original code imports random inside the function. But that's odd. Oh, that's in the function. Perhaps it's better to move the import outside, but in any case, the existing code imports random within the function.\\n\\nSo for the corrected code, perhaps:\\n\\ndef create_secure_token(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import secrets\\n    import string\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(size))\\n\\nWait, but in Python 3.6+, secrets has a choice function. Yes. So that's the correct way. So each character is selected using secrets.choice, which is cryptographically secure. And string is now imported to get the character sets.\\n\\nSo the original code's mistake was using random.choices, which is not secure. Also, the code might have been missing an import string, leading to a NameError, but perhaps that's part of the problem in the code.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code should:\\n\\n- Replace random with secrets.\\n\\n- Import string.\\n\\n- Use a generator expression with secrets.choice in a loop for size times.\\n\\nThis addresses the vulnerability identified by Bandit.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":329,\"completion_tokens\":1241,\"total_tokens\":1570},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis pointed out that using standard pseudo-random generators like random is not safe. So, what's the alternative?\\n\\nI remember that for security-sensitive stuff, the 'secrets' module is recommended because it generates cryptographically strong random numbers. So, replacing the 'random' module with 'secrets' should do the trick.\\n\\nLooking at the original code, they used random.choices. But wait, does the secrets module have an equivalent? I know secrets has choice, but does it have something like choices that takes a 'k' parameter for multiple selections?\\n\\nHmm, checking the documentation: the secrets module in Python has 'choice' to select a single element, but for multiple elements, you need to loop. Because for a password, each character should be chosen independently. So, using a list comprehension with secrets.choice and looping password_length times would work.\\n\\nSo, instead of random.choices, I can do [secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(password_length)] and then join that list. That way, each character is securely selected.\\n\\nAlso, need to make sure to import the secrets module instead of random. Let me check the existing code. Oh, the original code imports random inside the function. I should change that to import secrets, and adjust the code accordingly.\\n\\nWait, the original lines are:\\n\\nimport random\\n...\\nreturn ''.join(random.choices(...))\\n\\nSo, changing that to import secrets, and then return ''.join([secrets.choice(characters) for ...]).\\n\\nAlso, check if 'string' is imported? The code uses string.ascii_letters etc. Oh right, there's an import missing. The original code probably had 'import string' implicitly. Oh, but looking at the code, is there an import for string? Wait, in the original code, the line is 'characters = string.ascii_letters...' so they must have imported string. But in the given code, they didn't.

So that's another bug. But I guess that's not part of the vulnerability that Bandit reported. Wait, in the original code provided here, the user has written code that references string without importing the module. So that's an error.\\n\\nSo the correct code would need to add 'import string'. Otherwise, it would crash. So in the original code, there is an implicit assumption that the code is surrounded by imports for string, but in the actual code provided, the snippet misses 'import string', so that's an error.\\n\\nBut the vulnerability reported is about the PRNG. So, the code as given is incomplete but the user might not have noticed. Wait, looking back, the Bandit Analysis shows lines 10 and 11:\\n\\n10\\t    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n11\\t    return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=password_length))\\n\\nSo in their original code, the user probably included 'import string', but perhaps omitted it in the provided code.

So, there's a NameError because 'string' is not imported. So, that's an additional error. The original code has a flaw besides the random module usage. Oh! But that's separate from the security vulnerability. However, the user wants to fix the code so that the 'create_key' function works securely and correctly.\\n\\nSo, in the fix, I need to import string as well. Otherwise, when the code runs, it would throw an error. So, the corrected code should import 'string' inside or outside the function.\\n\\nWait, the original code has 'import random' inside the function. So, they have to import random there. Similarly, for string, they need to import the string module. So, adding 'import string' at the top of the function, perhaps. Alternatively, in the function's body or outside.\\n\\nBut since functions generally should have their imports either inside the function if they are used there, but sometimes code may have them imported at the top.\\n\\nIn any case, to make the function correct, in the original code, there is a missing import of string. So that's an error. Hence, the fixed code needs to include import string.\\n\\nTherefore, incorporating all fixes: replace the random module with secrets, fix the code to generate each character securely, and add the missing import of string. Wait, because in the original code, they used 'string' without importing it. So that will throw NameError: name 'string' is not defined.\\n\\nThus, corrected code should import string. But perhaps the original code as written by the user is incorrect. But the user provided that code as vulnerable, and the Bandit result was about the random module. Regardless, the fix must include ensuring that 'string' is imported, as well as replacing the RNG.\\n\\nSo putting this all together, the corrected code:\\n\\n- Inside the function or outside?\\n\\nAdditionally, in Python, it's common to import modules at the top, but the original code imports random inside the function. But for 'string', it's generally better to import once, but in this case, the code would need 'import string' added somewhere.\\n\\nLet me check:\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\ndef create_key(password_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import random\\n    if password_length \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(...)\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + ... \\n\\nSo, the original code is missing import string, which would cause a NameError. Hence, the code as provided is incorrect. So when fixing, the problem must address both the vulnerability and the missing import.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code should start with:\\n\\nimport string\\n\\nBut since in the given problem the code uses a function, perhaps the import is in the function. Like:\\n\\ndef create_key(...):\\n    import random  # this is unsafe\\n    # missing import string here.\\n\\nBut no. Alternatively, maybe the code has other parts where 'string' is imported.\\n\\nWait, the code as given in the 'Vulnerable Code' is:\\n\\ndef create_key(password_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG used to generate password (vulnerable code)\\n    import random\\n    if password_length \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Password length must be at least 8 characters.\\\")\\n    \\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=password_length))\\n# No additional code needed after the function.\\n\\nHere, string is used but not imported. So this code, if run, would crash. Therefore, to make this code correct, the fix must include importing the string module. But how did it pass Bandit? Well, perhaps in the actual original code of the user, the string module was imported elsewhere, but in the provided code snippet here, the import is missing.\\n\\nBut regardless, the fixed code must include the necessary imports.\\n\\nHence, when fixing the vulnerabilities, besides replacing random with secrets, we must add import string.\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\ndef create_key(password_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import string\\n    import secrets\\n    if password_length \\u003c 8:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Password length must be at least 8 characters.\\\")\\n    \\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join([secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(password_length)])\\n\\nSo, inside the function, import string and secrets. Then build the characters list. Then, for each character in the password, use secrets.choice from the characters.\\n\\nBut perhaps some people would say that imports should be at the top of the module, but since the original code imported random inside the function, perhaps this code would follow that pattern. Alternatively, the imports can stay inside the function.\\n\\nSo in this case, it's allowed to import modules inside the function, though it's not ideal. But for the purposes of fixing the code with minimal changes, adding the 'string' import inside the function would fix that error.\\n\\nThus, the final fixed function includes importing string and secrets, generating each character securely with secrets.choice, and done in a loop for the password_length.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":375,\"completion_tokens\":1981,\"total_tokens\":2356},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The user provided a code snippet and Bandit's analysis results. My job is to address each of the issues mentioned.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the XML part. Bandit says using xml.etree.ElementTree is unsafe, and they recommend using defusedxml instead. So I need to replace the imports and the fromstring method with defusedxml's implementation. The XML parsing is happening in the 'xml' encoding_type case. Instead of importing ET from xml.etree, I should import it from defusedxml. And then use their fromstring function. Wait, maybe using defusedxml's ElementTree module. So replace 'import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET' with 'from defusedxml import ElementTree as ET'? That way, all the methods like ET.fromstring would come from the defusedxml library, which is safer against XML attacks.\\n\\nNext, the pickle issues. Bandit flags both importing pickle and using pickle.loads. The problem is that deserializing untrusted data with pickle is a security risk because it can execute arbitrary code. So the right fix here is to remove support for pickle entirely. Since the data could come from untrusted sources, allowing pickle is dangerous. So instead of having the 'pickle' case in the elifs, we should remove that option. The original function raises an error for unsupported formats, so after removing the pickle case, any 'pickle' encoding_type will trigger the ValueError. That makes sense because there's no safe way to deserialize untrusted pickle data.\\n\\nSo steps to fix:\\n\\n1. For XML processing:\\n   - Replace the import of xml.etree.ElementTree with defusedxml's ElementTree.\\n   - Use ET.fromstring from defusedxml.\\n\\n2. For Pickle:\\n   - Remove the elif block that handles 'pickle' encoding_type.\\n   - This will cause any attempts to use 'pickle' to raise the existing ValueError about unsupported formats.\\n\\nNow, I should check if the defusedxml package is necessary. Since the original code doesn't mention dependencies, the fix should assume that defusedxml is installed. The code needs to import ElementTree from defusedxml instead of the standard library.\\n\\nTesting the changes. So, when encoding_type is 'xml', we import ET from defusedxml, and parse byte_data with it. Then process into a dictionary as before.\\n\\nFor the pickle part, remove those lines entirely.

The Bandit report says using eval is insecure because it can execute arbitrary code. The suggestion is to use ast.literal_eval instead. But wait, what's the difference between eval and literal_eval?\\n\\nEval takes a string and runs it as a Python expression, which can be dangerous if the input is untrusted. Literal_eval safely evaluates literals like strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, and None. So it can't execute functions or methods, making it safer.\\n\\nBut the original code is supposed to evaluate user-defined queries which might require more complex operations than just literals. Hmm, that's a problem. If the quizzes need to execute logic with operators or simple expressions, maybe literal_eval is too restrictive. Wait, what does the user's query look like? If it's just mathematical expressions or data structures, literal_eval works. But if they need to evaluate things like function calls or other code, then we can't use literal_eval.\\n\\nThe original function is part of a quiz app where users design custom quizzes, and their logic is executed. So maybe the use case requires more than literals. But using eval is a security risk.\\n\\nThis is a tricky situation. The problem says \\\"evaluates it as a Python expression\\\". If the function is intended to evaluate expressions safely, then replacing eval with literal_eval might not suffice for all cases. But given the security concerns, how do we balance functionality and security?\\n\\nIn the Bandit report, the vulnerability is about using eval which is unsafe. Therefore, the correct approach is to avoid using eval. Maybe we need to find a way to parse and evaluate the expression safely. If the user input is strictly for expressions that can be handled by literal_eval, then switching to ast.literal_eval is correct. But if not, then the original code's purpose can't be safely achieved, which is the root problem.\\n\\nBut according to the problem statement, the task is to fix the vulnerability. So the answer is to replace eval with ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nWait, but the original code may require evaluating more than literals. Maybe the function is intended to evaluate things like mathematical expressions. For example, if a student enters \\\"2 + 3\\\", literal_eval can't handle that because it's an expression. Because literal_eval is for literals only. Oh right, that's an issue.\\n\\nIn that case, using literal_eval won't work for evaluating expressions like 2 + 3. So then the code is vulnerable because it uses eval, but replacing with literal_eval breaks functionality.\\n\\nHmm. The user's code is for a quiz app where custom logic can be executed. So they probably need to evaluate more complex expressions, which is why eval was used. But using eval is unsafe. So there's a conflict between functionality and security.\\n\\nHow do we reconcile this? Is there a safe way to evaluate mathematical expressions without allowing arbitrary code execution?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the use case can be satisfied with a safe expression evaluator. There's a third-party library called 'simpleeval' that can evaluate expressions safely. But the problem might require using standard libraries only.\\n\\nAlternatively, parse the expression using ast and check for allowed nodes before evaluating. For example, using the ast module to parse the input into an abstract syntax tree, then walk through the nodes to ensure there are no function calls, imports, or other dangerous operations. Then compile the AST to code and execute it in a restricted environment.\\n\\nThat's more complicated. Since the problem expects us to fix the code based on Bandit's report which suggests using ast.literal_eval, maybe the best answer here is to substitute eval with literal_eval, even if it restricts the functionality. Or perhaps that the original code's use of eval is incorrect given the security concern, so the code must be adjusted even if it changes functionality.\\n\\nBut the problem states: \\\"your task is to fix the vulnerabilities and provide the corrected version.\\\"\\n\\nSo perhaps the answer is to use literal_eval and adjust the code accordingly.\\n\\nSo modifying the code to import ast and use ast.literal_eval instead of eval. Let's see:\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\ndef evaluate_student_response(student_query: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        result = eval(student_query)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nChanging eval to ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nWait, but then what if the user's query is something like \\\"[1, 2, 3]\\\" — literal_eval can handle that. But if it's \\\"2 + 3\\\", literal_eval will throw an error because that's a BinOp operation, not a literal. So using literal_eval will restrict the allowed queries.\\n\\nIf the requirement is to evaluate expressions, then replacing eval with literal_eval won't work. So this suggests that the original approach is insecure and that there's no straightforward fix. But the problem's bandit report suggests using literal_eval, maybe the problem expects that substitution, even if it changes functionality.\\n\\nBut according to the vulnerability report, the code is using an insecure function. So the correct fix is to replace eval with a safer method. But the question is, can we do that here? Because the functionality may not handle all expressions.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's code was supposed to only evaluate literals. So in that case, replacing with literal_eval is safer.\\n\\nIn the problem statement, the first paragraph says: \\\"user's query and evaluates it as a Python expression to produce a result.\\\" So the expectation is that it's supposed to evaluate expressions, not just literals. But eval is unsafe. So there might be a conflict.\\n\\nBut given the parameters of the problem, the correct answer according to Bandit is to replace eval with ast.literal_eval, perhaps. But let's double-check. For instance, if the user intends for the code to evaluate expressions like 5 + 3 * 2, then using literal_eval would throw an error. So that may not work. However, if the user is using the eval function to read data structures (like lists, dictionaries, etc.), then literal_eval is correct.\\n\\nAssuming that the code is intended to evaluate data literals, then replacing eval with ast.literal_eval is the proper fix even if that changes functionality. But the problem statement says it's for evaluating user-defined quizzes where \\\"user-defined logic can be executed\\\". So logic execution suggests that they need to evaluate more than just literals. But this is a huge security problem. Therefore, perhaps the original code is fundamentally flawed and there's no easy fix.\\n\\nBut since the Bandit report says to use literal_eval, perhaps this is the expected answer. So the code should be fixed by importing ast, then using ast.literal_eval. So let's code that.\\n\\nSo the fixed code:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef evaluate_student_response(student_query: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        result = ast.literal_eval(student_query)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut does this handle all the cases? For example, the user submits \\\"2 + 3\\\" which is a valid expression. With eval, it would result in 5, but with literal_eval, it raises an exception and returns \\\"Error!\\\". Therefore, this changes the functionality, but perhaps that's unavoidable to fix the security issue.\\n\\nIf the function's intended behavior is to evaluate arbitrary expressions securely, there's no straightforward way using standard libraries. But according to Bandit's suggestion, using literal_eval is the way to mitigate the vulnerability.\\n\\nThus, the correct answer is to replace eval with ast.literal_eval after importing ast.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":301,\"completion_tokens\":1642,\"total_tokens\":1943},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis flagged this as a security risk because using exec with untrusted code can lead to code injection attacks. The main problem here is that executing arbitrary code from a user can allow them to run dangerous commands or access sensitive parts of the system. \\n\\nThe task is to modify the 'execute_user_code' function so that it limits the executed script to safe operations. How can I achieve that?\\n\\nHmm, one approach is to restrict the environment in which the user's code runs. I should create a restricted namespace that excludes access to dangerous functions and modules. Using the exec function's globals and locals parameters to control the accessible variables and functions.\\n\\nMaybe I can define a dictionary that only allows certain built-in functions deemed safe. By overriding the __builtins__ key in the globals dictionary, I can limit access to the default built-in functions. For example, allow only specific builtins like 'print' or 'len', which are generally harmless. \\n\\nWait, but even with that, there might be ways for the user to escape the sandbox. How can I make sure they can't import modules or access other dangerous functions? Perhaps removing access to __import__, open, eval, etc. Also, certain attributes like '__builtins__' might need to be set to None in the restricted environment.\\n\\nSo, first, I'll create a dictionary for the globals that the user's code will use. Then, restrict the built-in functions. Set __builtins__ to a minimal set or even an empty dict to prevent access. That way, if the user tries to import something or access dangerous functions, it would raise an error.\\n\\nAnother consideration is timeouts. If the user's code runs an infinite loop, it could hang the program. However, handling that might be more complex, maybe requiring separate processes and signals, which might be beyond the scope here. The problem description might be focusing more on restricting the available functions rather than resource limits.\\n\\nSo the corrected code should replace the current 'exec' with a version that uses a restricted globals environment. Let's outline the steps:\\n\\n1. Create a new globals dictionary that restricts built-in functions.\\n2. Remove or limit access to dangerous modules and functions like os, subprocess, file operations.\\n3. Execute the user script within this restricted environment.\\n\\nTesting the solution: Suppose a user script tries to import os and do something. In the restricted environment, the __import__ function is not available, so it should fail.\\n\\nSo in code:\\n\\ndef execute_user_code(script_to_execute: str):\\n    restricted_globals = {\\n        '__builtins__': {\\n            # Only allow safe built-ins\\n            'print': print,\\n            'range': range,\\n            'len': len,\\n            # etc. Add more as needed, but carefully\\n        },\\n        # No other modules or variables by default\\n    }\\n    exec(script_to_execute, restricted_globals, restricted_globals)\\n    return None\\n\\nWait, but the __builtins__ in Python is a module that gives access to all built-in functions. So if we restrict __builtins__ to a dict containing only safe functions, then any access to other built-ins would be blocked. For example, the user code can't use open(), __import__, etc.\\n\\nSo that's the way to go. However, what if the script uses other built-in functions that are considered safe? The list of allowed built-ins can be curated based on which functions are safe.\\n\\nBut even then, allowing some functions could be risky. For example, allowing 'eval' would reintroduce the same problem. So in the restricted_globals, we should only include functions that are known to be harmless.\\n\\nAlternatively, setting __builtins__ to None would restrict access to all built-in functions, but then the user can't even use basic ones like print or len. It's a trade-off between functionality and security. But the problem states that the function should limit the script to \\\"operations considered safe,\\\" so the solution should allow necessary safe operations while blocking dangerous ones.\\n\\nAnother alternative is to override __builtins__ to a custom dictionary that excludes dangerous functions. Here's how that could look:\\n\\nsafe_builtins = {\\n    'print': print,\\n    'sum': sum,\\n    'len': len,\\n    # other safe built-ins\\n}\\n\\nrestricted_globals = {'__builtins__': safe_builtins}\\n\\nBut even with that, certain functions in the safe_builtins could be used in unintended ways. However, the goal is to minimize the risk.\\n\\nAlternatively, some approaches completely remove access to all built-in functions. For example:\\n\\nrestricted_globals = {\\n    '__builtins__': {},\\n    # other safe variables if needed\\n}\\n\\nBut then, even basic functions would not be available. So the user's script would be very limited.\\n\\nGiven that the original code used exec directly, and the problem wants to \\\"limit the script to operations considered safe,\\\" we need to balance between functionality and security. \\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code should include a restricted environment where access to dangerous functions is not possible. Here's the corrected code:\\n\\ndef execute_user_code(script_to_execute: str):\\n    allowed_globals = {'__builtins__': None}\\n    exec(script_to_execute, allowed_globals, allowed_globals)\\n    return None\\n\\nBut this might be too restrictive, allowing no built-in functions. The safest approach would be to disable all built-ins. If the user's script requires certain functions, perhaps the application expects them to use a subset. However, without additional context on which functions are considered safe, it's best to err on the side of maximum security.\\n\\nAlternatively, creating a custom __builtins__ that contains only the absolutely necessary safe functions. Let's choose that. For example:\\n\\nsafe_builtins = {'print': print, 'range': range, 'int': int, 'float': float, 'str': str, 'bool': bool}\\n\\nrestricted_globals = {'__builtins__': safe_builtins}\\n\\nBut even functions like 'dict' could lead to issues. However, it really depends on the allowed use cases. Since the problem statement is a bit vague on required functionality, but emphasizes security, perhaps removing __builtins__ entirely or allowing a very restricted set.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would replace the unrestricted 'exec' with one that uses a restricted global namespace. Considering all this, the corrected code will set the __builtins__ to a minimal set or None. Let's try:\\n\\ndef execute_user_code(script_to_execute: str):\\n    restricted_globals = {'__builtins__': {}}\\n    exec(script_to_execute, restricted_globals)\\n    return None\\n\\nThis restricts access to all built-in functions. So the user's code can't execute any built-in functions unless explicitly allowed. \\n\\nBut, even with __builtins__ set to an empty dict, some might still find a way to access built-ins. For example, if there's a way to get the built-ins from another module. So perhaps setting __builtins__ to None.\\n\\ndef execute_user_code(script_to_execute: str):\\n    exec(script_to_execute, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    return None\\n\\nBut I need to test this. If __builtins__ is None in the global namespace, then the user's code has no access to any built-in functions. That's a safer approach, but possibly too restrictive. However, according to the problem statement, the goal is to limit to safe operations, which this achieves by default.\\n\\nAlternatively, there might be solutions using the 'ast' module or code analysis before execution, but that's more complex. For the scope here, running the code in a restricted environment with no access to built-ins is a fix that addresses the Bandit warning and the code injection vulnerability.\\n\\nSo, replacing the exec with a version that restricts the globals and locals and removes built-ins would be the fix. Therefore, the corrected code would be:\\n\\ndef execute_user_code(script_to_execute: str):\\n    exec(script_to_execute, {'__builtins__': {}}, {})\\n    return None\\n\\nBut in Python, when you pass a globals dictionary that doesn't include __builtins__, the interpreter automatically adds a reference to the built-ins. However, if you set '__builtins__' to None or an empty dictionary, you can prevent access. Testing this, if the code is:\\n\\nexec(\\\"print('hello')\\\", {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n\\nIt would raise an error because print is not accessible. But how does Python handle the __builtins__ in the provided globals?\\n\\nAccording to Python's documentation, if the globals dictionary does not contain a __builtins__ key, that key is inserted. However, if it is present, that value is used. So by setting '__builtins__' to an empty dict, or None, you can control access.\\n\\nIn this case, setting '__builtins__' to an empty dict would mean that the user's code cannot access any built-in functions. That should mitigate the risk of code execution.\\n\\nThus, the final fixed code would use a restricted namespace with '__builtins__' limited to an empty dictionary, which blocks access to built-in functions. This should prevent the user's script from executing dangerous operations.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":265,\"completion_tokens\":2008,\"total_tokens\":2273},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The function execute_user_code directly runs user-provided code with exec, which is dangerous since it can execute arbitrary code. \\n\\nThe main problem is that exec can run any Python code, leading to potential security vulnerabilities like code injection. To fix this, I should restrict what the user's code can do. \\n\\nOne approach is to use a sandbox environment. Maybe create a restricted globals dictionary that limits available functions and modules. That way, I can block access to dangerous modules like os, sys, or subprocesses. \\n\\nSo, let's start by defining a safe_globals dict. I'll include builtins but only safe ones. Wait, maybe removing access to __import__ and other dangerous built-in functions. Or perhaps using a whitelist of allowed built-in functions. Like, for example, allowing only certain functions that are necessary for the user's code to run non-harmful operations.\\n\\nAlso, prevent the user from accessing modules that can perform harmful operations. I can override __import__ in the globals to block importing any modules. Alternatively, in the safe environment, modules like os are not accessible.\\n\\nAnother idea is to use the ast module to parse the submitted code and check for any unsafe operations before executing. For example, checking for import statements, function calls, or access to certain attributes. But that might be complex.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the restricted execution environments, although Python's restricted environments are not foolproof. However, for the purpose of this problem, creating a custom globals that restricts access to dangerous modules and functions.\\n\\nHmm, perhaps the simplest way is to create a globals dict that doesn't include any harmful modules. Here's how:\\n\\nDefine a custom globals that has limited access. So:\\n\\nsafe_globals = {\\n    '__builtins__': {\\n        'print': print,\\n        'range': range,\\n        'len': len,\\n        # add other safe builtins here, but exclude things like open, exec, eval, etc.\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nBut the user might still find a way to get around this. Wait, maybe setting __builtins__ to None? No, that might be too restrictive. Alternatively, limit __builtins__ to a very strict subset.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps replace __builtins__ with a controlled dictionary where only specific safe functions are allowed.\\n\\nAlso, make sure that the code can't access the actual system modules. So even if they try to import, it won't work.\\n\\nWait, here's an example approach. Override __import__ in the globals to prevent importing modules. Like:\\n\\ndef safe_import(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=(), level=0):\\n    raise ImportError(\\\"Importing modules is not allowed\\\")\\n\\nsafe_globals = {\\n    '__builtins__': {\\n        '__import__': safe_import,\\n        'print': print,\\n        'range': range,\\n        # allow other safe builtins here\\n    },\\n}\\n\\nThen pass this safe_globals to exec. So that when the user's code tries to import a module, it raises an error.\\n\\nBut how to handle builtins like open, which can access files. Those should be removed from the allowed builtins. So in the safe_globals under __builtins__, only include specific functions that are safe, like print, range, etc. Exclude open, eval, exec, etc.\\n\\nSo create a new __builtins__ dict that is a subset of the standard builtins, excluding any that can be used for harmful operations.\\n\\nBut how to do that in Python. The __builtins__ in a restricted environment can be replaced with a custom dict.\\n\\nSo here's the plan:\\n\\n- Create a custom_globals dictionary that restricts the available functions and modules.\\n- Remove access to dangerous functions (eval, exec, open, etc.).\\n- Prevent importing new modules by replacing __import__ to raise an error.\\n- Only include a whitelist of allowed built-in functions.\\n\\nSo modifying the execute_user_code function to use exec with the custom globals and locals set to this restricted environment.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\ndef execute_user_code(submitted_code: str):\\n    allowed_builtins = {\\n        'print': print,\\n        'range': range,\\n        'int': int,\\n        'str': str,\\n        'list': list,\\n        'dict': dict,\\n        # any other safe built-in functions\\n    }\\n\\n    safe_globals = {\\n        '__builtins__': allowed_builtins,\\n        # override __import__ to prevent imports\\n        '__import__': lambda *args, **kwargs: None,\\n    }\\n\\n    # Alternatively, raising an error on import.\\n    def safe_import(name, *args, **kwargs):\\n        raise RuntimeError(\\\"Imports are not allowed\\\")\\n\\n    safe_globals['__builtins__']['__import__'] = safe_import\\n\\n    # Also, remove any other unsafe built-in functions from allowed_builtins\\n    # Then exec the code with these globals\\n    exec(submitted_code, safe_globals)\\n\\nBut wait, in Python, if you set the __builtins__ key in a globals dict to a dict, that dict becomes the available built-ins. So in allowed_builtins, by not including anything dangerous, and by replacing __import__ to prevent importing, this restricts what the user can do.\\n\\nAnother thing: functions like getattr or accessing __class__ could be used to break out of the sandbox, but creating a completely secure sandbox in Python is known to be difficult. However, for the problem's sake, maybe restrict the builtins to a known safe subset and block import statements.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would look something like:\\n\\ndef execute_user_code(submitted_code: str):\\n    restricted_globals = {\\n        '__builtins__': {\\n            'print': print,\\n            'range': range,\\n            'abs': abs,\\n            'len': len,\\n            'max': max,\\n            'min': min,\\n            'sum': sum,\\n            # Other 'safe' built-ins as needed\\n        },\\n        '__import__': None,\\n    }\\n    exec(submitted_code, restricted_globals)\\n    return None\\n\\nWait, but setting __import__ to None would prevent using import statements? Let's test that.\\n\\nBut even better, perhaps to disable import by replacing __builtins__'s __import__ function. However, perhaps this approach is better as it blocks imports and restricts the functions available.\\n\\nAlternatively, another way: use the builtins module to create a custom __builtins__.\\n\\nBut considering the constraints, perhaps this is the way to go. Although note that in Python, modifying the __builtins__ in the globals is the way to control which built-in functions are available. So creating a new __builtins__ dict that has only allowed functions and replacing the __import__ with a function that raises an error if called.\\n\\nAnother idea: using a module like 'ast' to parse the code and check for unsafe nodes (like Import nodes, function definitions, etc.). But for the sake of this problem, maybe it's sufficient to limit the builtins.\\n\\nBut this may not completely prevent all possibilities. For example, someone can still do something like (lambda: [x for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() if x.__name__ == 'SpawnProcess'][0])() which could lead to code execution via subprocess. But if they can't access those classes or modules, this would be prevented. However, some basic types like tuples or lists may still be accessible.

The Bandit report suggests using ast.literal_eval instead. Wait, but literal_eval can only handle literals, right? The original code allows arithmetic expressions, like \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\". If I use literal_eval directly on the input, it won't evaluate expressions—only literals like strings, numbers, lists, etc. That's a problem because the function is supposed to evaluate arithmetic expressions.\\n\\nSo the issue is that eval can execute arbitrary code, which is dangerous. The user could input something like \\\"os.system('rm -rf /')\\\" which would be a disaster. I need to find a way to safely evaluate arithmetic expressions without using eval directly.\\n\\nHmm, maybe parse the input to check if it's a valid arithmetic expression first. Like, ensure that the input only contains numbers, operators, and maybe parentheses. Then use a restricted environment for evaluation.\\n\\nWait, what's the safest way here. Let's think. Using ast.literal_eval won't work for expressions. So alternative approaches? How about using a parser to verify the expression consists only of safe components, then evaluate it safely.\\n\\nThe function needs to take the input string, validate that it is indeed a mathematical expression with only allowed characters and structure, and then compute it. But even evaluating a simple expression with eval is risky unless properly sanitized.\\n\\nOne approach is to preprocess the input: check that the input string contains only numbers, basic operators (+, -, *, /, **), parentheses, and spaces. Then replace any other characters. But even then, certain combinations could be dangerous. For example, double underscores might allow access to special variables.\\n\\nAlternatively, using a whitelist of allowed characters. Let's see. So sanitize the input by only allowing digits, operators, parentheses, and whitespace. Then use eval in a restricted namespace that doesn't have access to built-in functions or modules.\\n\\nSo maybe something like this:\\n\\n1. Remove all whitespace from the input.\\n2. Check that the input only contains allowed characters (digits, +, -, *, /, **, ^, % maybe, parentheses, etc.).\\n3. Create a custom environment for eval, like replacing __builtins__ with None or an empty dict to prevent access to unsafe functions.\\n4. Use a try-except block to catch any errors during evaluation.\\n\\nWait, but the user might input something like \\\"2 + __import__('os').system('echo hacked')\\\", which would bypass the check. Even if the characters are allowed (like underscores and dots), the check would pass but the code would be dangerous. So just checking allowed characters isn't sufficient.\\n\\nAnother idea: parse the expression into an abstract syntax tree (AST) using the ast module, then check that the AST only contains allowed operations, like literals and arithmetic operations, and no function calls or attribute accesses.\\n\\nThis is more involved. Here's the plan:\\n\\n1. Parse the input into an AST with ast.parse.\\n2. Walk through the AST nodes and ensure that only safe nodes are present (like BinOp, Num, etc.).\\n3. If any unsafe nodes are found (like Call, Import, etc.), raise an error.\\n4. If the AST is safe, then evaluate the expression in a safe environment, perhaps using custom operators.\\n\\nWait, but building a secure AST checker is non-trivial. There might be existing libraries for that, but perhaps the user is expecting to fix it without adding dependencies.\\n\\nAlternatively, using a restricted subset of Python's syntax. Like, using the operator module and a namespace that only includes allowed functions.\\n\\nWait, maybe using a custom dictionary for the eval's globals and locals parameters, which only includes certain allowed functions or modules.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nallowed = {'__builtins__': None, 'abs': abs, 'max': max, 'min': min}  # etc.?\\n\\nBut I'm not sure how this will help for arithmetic expressions.\\n\\nAlternatively, an example fix: replace eval with a custom evaluator that's safe.\\n\\nBut perhaps the best approach here, given that the user is using this function to evaluate arithmetic expressions, is to use the ast.literal_eval. But wait, literal_eval doesn't evaluate expressions. Only literals. So that's not going to work.\\n\\nSo maybe the correct approach is to validate the input string to be a mathematical expression consisting of numbers and operators, and then evaluate it using a safe method.\\n\\nAnother alternative: use a simple sandboxed environment. For example, evaluate the expression with eval, but with a restricted globals dictionary that doesn't include any built-in functions or modules. Like:\\n\\ndef calculate_expression(expr_input: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        # Validate the expression to contain only allowed characters\\n        allowed_chars = set(\\\"0123456789+-*/.%() \\u0026|^~\\u003c\\u003e\\\")\\n        if not all(c in allowed_chars for c in expr_input.replace(' ', '')):\\n            return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n        # Use a restricted namespace\\n        result = eval(expr_input, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, but even without builtins, certain operations could still be dangerous. For example, if the input is \\\"(lambda: 2+2)()\\\", then even if __builtins__ is None, that creates a lambda and executes it. Without built-ins, maybe most of the dangerous operations can't access the system. Hmm.\\n\\nHowever, in that case, the code would evaluate such a lambda and return 4, but perhaps that's outside the scope of intended functionality. The original problem says the function is to evaluate arithmetic expressions. The user might accept or not accept that. But the user probably expects the function to support basic math operations only.\\n\\nBut the original code could evaluate any valid Python expression, which is a security risk. So the goal is to allow arithmetic expressions but prevent code execution.\\n\\nUsing a regex to validate that the input only contains numbers, whitespace, and certain operators before passing to eval.\\n\\nBut regex can get complicated. For example, making sure that the expression is a valid mathematical one, but even that is tricky. For example, the input \\\"1 + 2\\\" is okay, but \\\"1 + (2 * 3)\\\" is okay. What about \\\"1e2 + 3\\\", scientific notation? Need to allow that.\\n\\nBut even if we do a regex check, certain constructs can bypass it. For instance, (1).__class__ would access the __class__ attribute of the int, which is allowed even if the regex allows numbers and parentheses. But __class__ can lead to access to object methods, which might be dangerous.\\n\\nSo the proper way is probably to use a parser to check that the expression is a simple mathematical one.\\n\\nAlternative library: Using a safe evaluator like using the 'asteval' module (which is a third-party library) but I don't know if that's allowed here.\\n\\nGiven that the problem says \\\"corrected version of the code\\\" and we can't add external dependencies, we need another solution.\\n\\nSo maybe here's a plan:\\n\\nChange the code to first validate the input to contain only allowed characters (digits, +, -, *, /, ^, %, ., parentheses, and spaces), then use a restricted namespace for eval, without any builtins.\\n\\nBut even that is not safe, as using '__' in variable names could allow access to special attributes.\\n\\nHmm. Alternatively, pre-process the expression, evaluating it with a limited set of allowed operations.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the answer is to use ast.literal_eval for this. But wait, literal_eval can't handle expressions. For instance, \\\"2 + 3\\\" when given to ast.literal_eval throws an error. Because '+' is not part of a literal. So replacing eval with literal_eval would not work, it would cause errors in legitimate arithmetic expressions.\\n\\nSo the given code uses eval to compute the result, which is unsafe, and the Bandit report suggests switching to ast.literal_eval—but that might not be possible. The analyst may have suggested this because eval is dangerous, but the context here is that the user inputs a mathematical operation. So this is a case where the original code's approach is vulnerable, but the suggestion from Bandit is not applicable. So the developer might need to use a different method.\\n\\nAlternative approach: Use the operator module with a parser that converts the input into a safe evaluated expression.\\n\\nWait, but how to parse and compute arithmetic operations... perhaps using the 'numexpr' library or 'simpleeval' library. But again, code can’t require external libraries unless instructed. The problem says to fix the code, which would necessitate using standard libraries.\\n\\nPossibly, implementing a safe parser is not trivial, but given that, perhaps the best solution under the constraints is to sanitize the input and use a restricted environment for eval.\\n\\nSo for example:\\n\\ndef calculate_expression(expr_input: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        # Sanitize the input to only allow mathematical characters\\n        allowed = set(\\\"0123456789+-*/.%() \\\")\\n        if not all(c in allowed for c in expr_input):\\n            return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n        # Further check using AST parsing\\n        import ast\\n        tree = ast.parse(expr_input, mode='eval')\\n        for node in ast.walk(tree):\\n            if not isinstance(node, (ast.Expression, ast.BinOp, ast.UnaryOp, ast.Num, ast.Operator, ast.add, ast.Sub, ast.Mult, ast.Div, ast.Mod, ast.Pow, ast.USub)):\\n                return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n        # Evaluate with no built-ins\\n        result = eval(expr_input, {\\\"__builtins__\\\": None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, this code uses ast.parse to parse the input and walks through the nodes, checking that only certain node types are allowed. If any other node types like Call, Name, etc., are present, it returns an error.\\n\\nBut implementing this requires walking the AST. The code above may not work as written. For example, the allowed node types must carefully exclude any dangerous ones.\\n\\nFor example, binop is allowed. However, this code is missing some steps.\\n\\nWait, parsing the input as an Expression, then check that all nodes are safe. Let me work this out.\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef is_safe_expression(expr):\\n    try:\\n        tree = ast.parse(expr, mode='eval')\\n    except SyntaxError:\\n        return False\\n    allowed_nodes = (ast.Expression, ast.BinOp, ast.UnaryOp, ast.Num, ast.Constant, ast.Operator, ast.Add, ast.Sub, ast.Mult, ast.Div, ast.Mod, ast.Pow, ast.USub, ast.UAdd)\\n    for node in ast.walk(tree):\\n        if not isinstance(node, allowed_nodes):\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\nBut in Python 3.8+, ast.Constant is used instead of ast.Num, so we may need to handle that. Also, other nodes like attribute accesses (ast.Attribute) or calls (ast.Call) must be excluded.\\n\\nAssuming that the ast.parse in 'eval' mode parses the expression. The problem is that the code may involve more than arithmetic, like list comprehensions, function calls, which are dangerous.\\n\\nIn any case, combining input sanitization (characters check) and AST validation to allow only safe operations, then evaluating in a restricted environment.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\nBut this requires implementing that, but perhaps for the purpose of this exercise, here's the fixed code.\\n\\nWait, but in the initial function, it uses the code and returns the computation. The original code also catches all exceptions and returns \\\"Computation Error!\\\".\\n\\nSo the fixed code would involve:\\n\\n- Parsing the input with ast to check it's a valid expression, then evaluating it in a safe context.\\n\\nThus, combining multiple steps. Maybe using a safe_eval function.\\n\\nHere's an example solution that validates the input via AST parsing and allowed characters:\\n\\ndef calculate_expression(expr_input: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        import ast\\n        # Check that the expression contains only allowed characters\\n        allowed_chars = set(\\\"0123456789+-*/.%() \\\")\\n        expr_clean = expr_input.replace(' ', '')\\n        if not all(c in allowed_chars for c in expr_clean):\\n            return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n        # Parse the expression into an AST\\n        tree = ast.parse(expr_input, mode='eval')\\n        # Check each node in the AST\\n        for node in ast.walk(tree):\\n            if isinstance(node, (ast.Call, ast.Attribute, ast.Name, ast.Subscript)):\\n                # Disallow function calls, attribute access, variables, etc.\\n                return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n        # Evaluate in a safe environment\\n        result = eval(expr_input, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nThis code first checks for allowed characters (digits, basic operators, parentheses, and spaces). Then it parses the input as an AST. Then it checks for any nodes that are Call, Attribute (like obj.attr), Name (variables), Subscript (like [] accesses) and if found, rejects them. Then evaluates with no builtins, which should prevent accessing dangerous functions.\\n\\nThis approach restricts the input to pure arithmetic operations. Functions like abs() would be rejected since they involve a Call node. Variables are also not allowed.\\n\\nThis way, expressions like \\\"2+3*4\\\", \\\"3.14*(2^5)\\\", etc., are allowed, but any function calls or attribute accesses are blocked.\\n\\nPotential drawbacks: The allowed character check may be overtly strict. For example, allowing '^' might be an issue because in Python it's the bitwise XOR operator, not exponentiation (which is **). But maybe the user intended to parse these, or not. However, according to the original code, they might expect users to input Python syntax. So adjusting allowed characters would allow the users to input expressions using Python's operations.\\n\\nAnother point is that the code after catching the AST, uses eval(expr_input, {'__builtins__': None}, {}), which ensures that during evaluation, there are no imported modules or built-in functions accessible. This reduces the risk. Additionally, the AST nodes check blocks any Call, Name, etc. So any function calls would have already been rejected during the AST check.\\n\\nThus, combining the character check, AST validation, and safe evaluation environment should fix the vulnerability.\\n\\nHowever, this code is not tested here, and might have edge cases, but for the purpose of this problem, this might bẹ the fixed code requested.\\n\\nBut since the original code allows 'eval', but the wz_solution needs to avoid using 'eval' in a bad way, the key is to ensure that user input is properly validated to onlycontain safe arithmetic operations.\\n\\nSo the fixed code implements all these steps.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":296,\"completion_tokens\":3318,\"total_tokens\":3614},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit report mentioned that using eval is insecure because it can execute arbitrary code, leading to possible code injection attacks. The recommendation is to use ast.literal_eval instead, but wait, ast.literal_eval only safely evaluates literals like strings, numbers, tuples, etc. But the original code was evaluating arithmetic expressions.\\n\\nHmm, because if the user is inputting arithmetic expressions like \\\"3 + 5 * 2\\\", ast.literal_eval won't evaluate that. Because literal_eval doesn't parse expressions, only data structures. So replacing eval with ast.literal_eval here would break the functionality. So that's not the solution.\\n\\nSo, the problem here is using eval with untrusted input, which can lead to security issues. For example, a user could input something like __import__('os').system('rm -rf /') which would be dangerous.\\n\\nSo I need a way to safely evaluate arithmetic expressions. Alternatives to eval could be to parse the expression and evaluate it in a safer way.\\n\\nMaybe using a library or a parser that only handles mathematical operations. Alternatively, use a restricted environment for eval.\\n\\nWait, another approach is to sanitize the input string to ensure it only contains allowed characters (digits, operators, parentheses). Make sure that the expression contains only valid mathematical characters before evaluating.\\n\\nSo the plan is: first, validate the input expression to make sure it only contains allowed characters (like 0-9, +, -, *, /, ., spaces, maybe parentheses). If there's any invalid character, return an error. Then, use eval but perhaps in a more controlled way.\\n\\nThis way, even if someone tries to inject malicious code, the input validation would block it.\\n\\nSo first, import the necessary modules like re for regular expressions.\\n\\nThen, write a regular expression that matches valid arithmetic expressions. Let's think: allowed characters are digits, basic operators (+, -, *, /), decimal points, parentheses, and whitespace. So regex pattern could be something like ^[0-9+\\\\-*/() .]+$ (but need to make sure the hyphen is escaped properly in the regex).\\n\\nWait, but exponents ** or other syntax? But the original problem says \\\"basic arithmetic expressions\\\", maybe like add, subtract, multiply, divide, and parentheses, no variables or function calls.\\n\\nSo, perhaps creating a regex that checks if the input contains only these allowed characters. Otherwise, reject the expression.\\n\\nOnce it's validated, then using eval would be safer because there's no arbitrary code.\\n\\nSo, modifying the code to:\\n\\nimport re\\n\\ndef compute_expression(expression: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Check if the expression contains only allowed characters\\n    allowed_chars = r'^[\\\\d+\\\\-*/(). \\\\/]+$'  # Adjust the regex as needed\\n    if not re.match(allowed_chars, expression):\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    try:\\n        # Use eval but in a restricted environment? Like only containing safe names.\\n        # Or create a dictionary of allowed built-ins (none?)\\n        result = eval(expression, {\\\"__builtins__\\\": None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, but even with regex, there could be some tricky parts. For example, if the user passes something like \\\"1 + __import__('os').system('echo hacked')\\\", but the regex would block underscores and letters. Oh, wait because the allowed chars would not include letters. So if the regex is strict enough to exclude letters, then that code injection couldn't happen.\\n\\nSo the regex should disallow any a-zA-Z characters. Original allowed_chars includes digits, +, -, *, /, (, ), ., space. Maybe that's the case.\\n\\nLet's write the regex as follows:\\n\\npattern = r'^[\\\\s\\\\d+\\\\-*/\\\\(\\\\)\\\\.]+$'\\n\\nBut need to test for this pattern. Let's see: any digits (\\\\d), spaces (\\\\s), plus, minus (escaped as \\\\-), multiply, divide, parentheses (escaped as \\\\( and \\\\)), and decimal points.\\n\\nSo the regex would allow expressions like \\\"3 + 4 * (2 - 5.6)\\\".\\n\\nBut any letters or other symbols would not be allowed. So __import__ would be blocked because of the underscores and letters.\\n\\nBut wait, what about variable names? For example, if the user references a variable that's already in the context. But since the problem statement says basic arithmetic expressions, variable names shouldn't be part of the input.\\n\\nSo by using the regex, invalid characters are excluded. Then, even using eval may be safe.\\n\\nMoreover, when using eval, sometimes you can limit the globals and locals. For example, providing an empty dictionary for globals and locals so that no names are accessible.\\n\\nSo combining the regex validation with a restricted environment in eval.\\n\\nWait, in the code above, when calling eval(expression, {\\\"__builtins__\\\": None}, {}}), the second and third arguments are the globals and locals dictionaries. By setting __builtins__ to None, the eval environment will not have access to built-in functions or modules, which prevents executing arbitrary code. Then, even if the regex is bypassed somehow, the code would not have access to builtins.\\n\\nSo combining the regex check and safe eval with no builtins.\\n\\nSo step by step:\\n\\n1. Sanitize the input with a regex to allow only basic arithmetic characters.\\n\\n2. Evaluate the expression in a restricted environment, with no access to builtins or other modules.\\n\\nSo the code could look like:\\n\\nimport re\\n\\ndef compute_expression(expression: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Regex pattern to match allowed characters\\n    pattern = r'^[\\\\d\\\\s+\\\\-*/\\\\(\\\\)\\\\.]+$'\\n    if not re.fullmatch(pattern, expression):\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    try:\\n        # Evaluate in a restricted environment without builtins\\n        result = eval(expression, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, but does the regex fully account for valid arithmetic expressions?\\n\\nFor example, something like \\\"5.6 + 3.2e5\\\"? Wait, exponents or scientific notation like 3e5. The current regex doesn't include 'e' as a allowed character. But then again, the problem statement says \\\"basic arithmetic expressions.\\\" So maybe the users are allowed numbers like 3e5 depends on whether that's considered \\\"basic arithmetic\\\".\\n\\nBut if the regex excludes 'e', then such expressions would fail. So if we need to support numbers with exponents, that complicates.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the problem says that the inputs are basic arithmetics (without scientific notation), then underscores and letters are invalid.\\n\\nBut the original example probably used standard Python eval. So maybe the function expects both integers and floats, including scientific notation. So what to do?\\n\\nEnter the problem description: the user submitted expressions use Python syntax. However, allowing \\\"3e2\\\" would require 'e', which the current regex doesn't allow. So perhaps the initial code would accept that, so the fix shouldn't break that.\\n\\nWait, if the original code used eval, which does understand exponent notation, and in the regex we need to include 'e' and 'E' as allowed characters. Otherwise, the fix would disrupt legitimate input.\\n\\nHmm, this complicates the regex. So the allowed pattern now must include possible numbers in scientific notation (7e3, 5.6E+4).\\n\\nThat means allowing lower and uppercase 'e' and perhaps '+' signs in the exponent part.\\n\\nWait, how do Python numbers with exponents look like?\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n'123', '123.45', '-56.7', '7e3', '-8E-2', '9.5e+1'\\n\\nSo possible allowed characters for the numbers: digits, decimal points, plus/minus signs (but only allowed as unary operators or in exponents?\\n\\nWait, but the regex is matching the entire expression. The '-' could be both subtraction and unary minus. The '+' can be addition or unary plus, but those are allowed.\\n\\nBut allowing '+' and '-' in more contexts. Wait, in the regex, what's covered? Let's look:\\n\\npattern = r'^[\\\\d\\\\s+\\\\-*/\\\\(\\\\)\\\\.]+$'\\n\\nBut, +, -, * , /, (, ), . , digits, spaces.\\n\\nWait, but in the regex, the \\\"+\\\" is inside the character class. So the plus is allowed. The - is allowed but needs to be placed such that it doesn't create a range.\\n\\nIn the current regex [\\\\d\\\\s+\\\\-*/\\\\(\\\\)\\\\.], the \\\\s is any whitespace, then +, then \\\\- which is the '-', then *, /, etc.\\n\\nSo + is a literal, -, as well. So in the regex, '+' and '-' are allowed. But in the case of something like '1e3', but e is not allowed. Wait, but with the current regex, e is not included. So any expression with 'e' or 'E' would fail the regex and return computation error.\\n\\nBut the original code, using eval, would accept such expressions and compute them. So by adding this regex check, we would have changed the functionality. Which might be a problem.\\n\\nSo the Bandit vulnerability says that using eval is unsafe, and we need to fix that, but we need to do so without breaking legitimate use cases. So how do we allow all valid arithmetic expressions but disallow anything that could lead to code execution.\\n\\nAlternative approach: instead of blacklisting characters, parse the expression to check that it's a valid mathematical expression. But that's complex.\\n\\nAlternative idea: Use a mathematical expression evaluator library that's safe, like asteval, but that may require third-party libraries. However, the problem expects a solution that works with standard Python.\\n\\nAlternative plan: Use a safer alternative to eval by parsing the expression only into numbers and operators.\\n\\nAlternatively, replace all the variables and other things with sanitized versions.\\n\\nWait, here's another approach:\\n\\nEvaluate the expression by first converting it into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and then verifying that each node in the tree is allowed (only numbers and operators).\\n\\nBut this is complicated. Though, the ast module can help here.\\n\\nSo the steps would involve parsing the expression into an AST, then walking through the AST nodes and making sure only certain types are allowed (like BinOp, constants, etc.), rejecting any calls, attributes, names, etc.\\n\\nBut how to do that?\\n\\nAn example approach:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef check_expression(node):\\n    allowed_types = (ast.Expression, ast.BinOp, ast.UnaryOp, ast.Constant,\\n                     ast.Add, ast.Sub, ast.Mult, ast.Div, ast.USub, ast.UAdd)\\n    if isinstance(node, allowed_types):\\n        for child in ast.iter_child_nodes(node):\\n            check_expression(child)\\n    else:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Not allowed\\\")\\n\\ndef compute_expression(expression: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        tree = ast.parse(expression, mode='eval')\\n        check_expression(tree)\\n    except:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    try:\\n        result = eval(compile(tree, filename='', mode='eval'))\\n    except:\\n        return \\\"Computation Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nThis way, the AST is validated to include only safe elements.\\n\\nIn the check_expression function, we allow expressions that consist of constants, binary operations (add, sub, mult, div), unary operations (positive and negative). Other nodes like function calls, attribute accesses, etc., raise an error.\\n\\nThis approach would allow expressions like '3 + 5 * (2 - 4)', but block any names or function calls.\\n\\nThis seems more secure. Moreover, using ast.literal_eval is not suitable here as it doesn't evaluate expressions.\\n\\nThis method compiles the AST to an evaluation expression, which is then safely evaluated because the AST has already been checked for safety.\\n\\nThis way, we avoid using eval directly on the raw input string, thus preventing code injection.\\n\\nTesting this approach:\\n\\nIf someone tries to input \\\"os.system('ls')\\\", then the ast.parse would construct a Call node, which the check_expression function would reject. Because Call nodes are not in the allowed_types. Thus, the check would raise ValueError, resulting in \\\"Computation Error\\\".\\n\\nSimilarly, for variables named __import__ or any other names, the ast.parse would generate a Name node, which is not allowed, thus again returning an error.\\n\\nOnly expressions with constants (numbers) and the allowed operators are permitted.\\n\\nSo integrating this into the original code.\\n\\nThe revised code would:\\n\\n- Parse the input into an AST.\\n\\n- Check the AST nodes to only allow certain types (like constants, binary operations).\\n\\n- If nodes are allowed, evaluate the compiled AST.\\n\\nOtherwise, return error.\\n\\nThis is more secure and avoids the use of eval with raw strings. The Bandit warning about eval is addressed not by removing eval but by ensuring the evaluated code is safe.\\n\\nThus, the fixed code should adopt this approach.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":296,\"completion_tokens\":2903,\"total_tokens\":3199},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

Because literal_eval can't evaluate expressions. So that wouldn't work here. Then, what's the alternative?\\n\\nThe requirement is to support basic arithmetic and string manipulations safely. How to evaluate expressions without using eval? One approach is to parse the input and validate that it only contains allowed operations and literals.\\n\\nWait, maybe a custom evaluator using the ast module? For example, parse the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree and then walk through the nodes to check if they're allowed. That way, we can ensure that only safe operations are executed.\\n\\nThe original code was using eval, which is risky. The user supplied a string which could be any code. So replacing eval with ast.literal_eval isn't enough because it's only for data structures, not expressions.\\n\\nSo the solution needs to evaluate arithmetic expressions but do so safely. Let's think about implementing a safe evaluator.\\n\\nOne possible approach is to use the ast module to parse the input, check each node to see if it's an allowed operation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.), and only evaluate if all nodes are in the allowed list.\\n\\nAdditionally, for string manipulations, perhaps operations like string concatenation are allowed, but without any method calls that could be dangerous.\\n\\nAlternatively, using a restricted environment, like a dictionary that only includes safe built-in functions or overrides the __builtins__ to be empty except for what's necessary.\\n\\nSo, steps:\\n\\n1. Parse the input code_str into an AST.\\n2. Traverse the AST to ensure only allowed nodes are present (e.g., expressions involving numbers, strings, basic math operations, etc.).\\n3. If any disallowed nodes are found (like function calls, attribute accesses), reject execution.\\n4. Only evaluate if the AST is safe.\\n\\nImplementing AST validation would make the code safer.\\n\\nSo, writing an AST validator.\\n\\nFor example, allowed nodes might include:\\n\\n- Expression (top level)\\n- BinOp (binary operations like +, -, *, /)\\n- UnaryOp (unary minus, like -5)\\n- Constants (numbers, strings)\\n- For string manipulations, perhaps checking that only + is allowed (concatenation).\\n\\nBut need to make sure that there's no access to variables, function calls, etc.\\n\\nImplementing a node visitor that checks these conditions.\\n\\nHere's a possible structure:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\nclass SafeEvaluator(ast.NodeVisitor):\\n    def visit_Expr(self, node):\\n        self.visit(node.value)\\n\\n    def visit_BinOp(self, node):\\n        if not isinstance(node.op, (ast.Add, ast.Sub, ast.Mult, ast.Div)):\\n            raise ValueError(\\\"Unsupported operation\\\")\\n        self.visit(node.left)\\n        self.visit(node.right)\\n\\n    def visit_UnaryOp(self, node):\\n        if isinstance(node.op, (ast.USub, ast.UAdd)):\\n            self.visit(node.operand)\\n        else:\\n            raise ValueError(\\\"Unsupported unary operation\\\")\\n\\n    def visit_Constant(self, node):\\n        return  # Allow all constants (int, float, str)\\n\\n    def generic_visit(self, node):\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Disallowed node type\\\")\\n\\nThen, in the evaluate_user_code function, parse the code_str into an AST, check it with the SafeEvaluator, and evaluate it in a restricted environment.\\n\\nWait, but evaluating it after checking. Maybe using a subset of Python's syntax, but how?\\n\\nAlternatively, after ensuring that the AST is safe, use the operator module functions to compute the result.\\n\\nAlternatively, after validating the AST, we can generate the result safely.\\n\\nAnother approach is to use a limited namespace, like {'__builtins__': None} to prevent access to any functions or modules. However, arithmetic operations like + will still work. Let's test that.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvaluating \\\"1+2*3\\\" with eval(..., {'__builtins__': None}) would return 7, right? That should work.\\n\\nBut in that case, would string operations also work? Like \\\"'a' + 'b'\\\" would become 'ab'.\\n\\nBut even with __builtins__ set to None, does it prevent access to variables or other modules? Maybe?\\n\\nSo the fix could be replacling the eval with a restricted environment.\\n\\nBut perhaps the user-supplied code could try to access variables that aren't in the restricted environment, leading to NameError. However, if the code is self-contained arithmetic and string expressions without variables, then using a restricted environment might help.\\n\\nWait, in the original problem statement, the user-supplied code is a small script for basic arithmetic and string operations. So the code_str could be something like \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\" 'hello' + 'world' \\\".\\n\\nSo, perhaps using a limited globals dictionary that doesn't allow any built-in functions or variables.\\n\\nOriginal code uses eval(code_str). This can do any operations, so changing the eval to have a restricted namespace would help.\\n\\nSo fixed code could be:\\n\\ndef evaluate_user_code(code_str: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        ast.parse(code_str, mode='eval')  # Ensure it's a single expression\\n    except:\\n        return \\\"Execution Blocked!\\\"\\n    allowed_names = {}  # No allowed variables\\n    try:\\n        result = eval(code_str, {'__builtins__': None}, allowed_names)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Execution Blocked!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nWait, first, parse the code_str as an expression (using mode='eval'), which ensures that it's a single expression and cannot contain statements. If parsing as an expression raises an error, then return blocked.\\n\\nThen evaluate with a restricted environment where __builtins__ is None and no variables are allowed. This would prevent access to any functions or modules. So expressions like 1 + 2, \\\"a\\\" + \\\"b\\\" should work, because they don't require any built-in functions. But string manipulation functions like \\\"a\\\".upper() would be blocked because __builtins__ is not available.\\n\\nIs that the case?\\n\\nTesting:\\n\\nIf the code_str is \\\"1 + 2\\\", eval(code_str, {'__builtins__': None}, {}) returns 3.\\n\\nIf code_str is \\\"'a' + 'b'\\\", returns 'ab'.\\n\\nBut if code_str is \\\"__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')\\\", then since __builtins__ is set to None, the __import__ function is not available, so this would raise a NameError, which the function would catch and return \\\"Execution Blocked!\\\".\\n\\nHowever, code_str that uses variables would fail, but since there are no variables provided, that's acceptable.\\n\\nThis approach allows arithmetic operations and string concatenation but prevents using any functions or methods.\\n\\nWhat about method calls? For example, \\\"'x'.upper()\\\". But in the restricted environment, this would try to access the 'upper' method of the string. However, even with __builtins__ set to None, method calls are allowed. Wait, does that code work?\\n\\nWait, 'x'.upper() is a method call. The 'upper' method is part of the string object. When __builtins__ is removed, the availability of methods depends on the object's own methods. Since the string 'x' has an upper method, even without builtins, the method exists. So evaluating 'x'.upper() would produce 'X'.\\n\\nIs that a problem? Because the task says \\\"string manipulations\\\" are allowed, but maybe that's considered part of basic string operations. But maybe the user wants to prevent method calls, considering they can lead to unexpected issues. For example, \\\"().__class__.__base__\\\" etc., but if __builtins__ are None and there's no access to locals, but for example, calculate something via attributes.\\n\\nWait, but in our case, the allowed operations include string manipulations. So perhaps allowing basic method calls on strings, but methods that do things like executing code would be a problem. Wait, for instance, if a string contains \\\"eval('...')\\\" could be risky, but in our case, __builtins__ are None, so if the code has eval('something'), that would not work since eval is not available (because __builtins__ is None).\\n\\nBut 'x'.upper() is safe, right? It's just returning uppercase. So perhaps allowing such method calls is acceptable.\\n\\nBut then, could there be more dangerous methods? For example, \\\"bytes('...')\\\" or others? But perhaps the initial problem statement allows string manipulations like upper, lower.\\n\\nBut according to the original problem statement, the code needs to support \\\"string manipulations\\\", so maybe those are allowed.\\n\\nHowever, fixing this would require allowing method calls but only if they are on literals and safe.\\n\\nBut how to determine which methods are allowed? That complicates things. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe using the original approach with ast.literal_eval but that isn't sufficient. Let's recall that ast.literal_eval only parses literals, not expressions like 1 + 2. So would break the intended functionality.\\n\\nThe problem here is the original code does use eval and is insecure, but the replacement isn't straightforward. \\n\\nSo, the steps to fix the code need to both allow safe evaluation of arithmetic and string expressions but disallow any dangerous code.\\n\\nThe code can first parse the input as an expression (mode='eval') to ensure it's a single expression, then check the AST nodes for allowed types (like BinOp, Constant, etc.), then evaluate with a restricted environment.\\n\\nThis approach combines AST validation with a safe evaluation environment.\\n\\nSo here's a possible corrected code:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef evaluate_user_code(code_str: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        tree = ast.parse(code_str, mode='eval')\\n    except SyntaxError:\\n        return \\\"Execution Blocked!\\\"\\n\\n    allowed_nodes = {\\n        ast.Expression,\\n        ast.BinOp,\\n        ast.UnaryOp,\\n        ast.Constant,\\n        ast.Add,\\n        ast.Sub,\\n        ast.Mult,\\n        ast.Div,\\n        ast.USub,\\n        ast.UAdd\\n    }\\n\\n    for node in ast.walk(tree):\\n        if type(node) not in allowed_nodes:\\n            return \\\"Execution Blocked!\\\"\\n\\n    try:\\n        result = eval(compile(tree, filename=\\\"\\u003cstring\\u003e\\\", mode=\\\"eval\\\"), {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Execution Blocked!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut let's check:\\n\\n- The code first parses the expression. If invalid syntax, returns blocked.\\n\\n- Then it walks through the AST nodes and checks if all nodes are in the allowed list. Any other node types (e.g., Call, Attribute, etc.) will cause blocking.\\n\\n- This restricts the code to expressions with mathematical operations and constants. So, for example, \\\"1 + 2 * 3\\\" is allowed, \\\"(1 +2)*(3-4)\\\" is allowed. \\\"len('abc')\\\" would be blocked because len is a function call, which would generate a Call node not allowed. \\n\\nMethod calls like \\\" 'a'.upper() \\\" would generate a Call node (since upper is called), so that node type isn't allowed, hence blocked.\\n\\nThen, evaluating the compiled code in a restricted environment.\\n\\nBut note that 'a' + 'b' is allowed because it's handled by the allowed BinOp. So that would pass.\\n\\nThis way, basic arithmetic and string operations (without method calls) are allowed. Any function calls, variables, etc., are rejected.\\n\\nSo the combination of AST validation and restricted environments would make the function safe.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code would involve checking the AST nodes to enforce only allowed operations and evaluating in a restricted environment without builtins.\\n\\nSo, writing that code.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":297,\"completion_tokens\":2722,\"total_tokens\":3019},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

Instead of using random, I should switch to using secrets. But wait, the secrets module doesn't have a choices function, right?

The Bandit analysis pointed out that using random.choices is a bad idea here because it's a pseudo-random generator and not safe for security.\\n\\nSo, I should replace the random module with a more secure alternative. In Python, the 'secrets' module is designed for generating secure random numbers, suitable for passwords and security tokens. That module uses a cryptographically strong random number generator.\\n\\nLooking at the original code, they use random.choices. Let me check the functions available in the secrets module. Oh right, secrets has 'choice' but not a 'choices' function that takes a 'k' parameter. Wait, how can I generate multiple characters then?\\n\\nMaybe I need to loop 'key_length' times and each time select a random character using secrets.choice. So, instead of ''.join(random.choices(...)), I can do ''.join([secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(key_length)]). Yes, that makes sense because secrets.choice picks a random element from a sequence securely.\\n\\nAlso, I should remember to import the secrets module. Oh, and the original code had 'import random' inside the function. Wait, no—looking back, no, wait in the original code, 'import random' is inside the function? Let me check the vulnerable code. The original code starts with 'import random' inside the function? Let me see:\\n\\nThe function is written as:\\n\\ndef generate_secure_key(key_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Using weak pseudo-random number generator (vulnerable code)\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=key_length))\\n\\nYes, the import is inside the function. That's not great practice, but maybe it's acceptable. But now, when changing to secrets, I need to import secrets. So inside the function, after removing the 'import random', but wait, I should move the import to the top? No, the existing code may have it inside. However, since the code snippet uses 'string' module (like string.ascii_letters), the user probably has 'import string' somewhere. Wait, in the original code, is string imported? Let me see:\\n\\nThey have 'characters = string.ascii_letters + ...' so the code must import the string module. So the user has imported string in the code. The original code however, probably missed the import. Wait, that's an error. Wait, in the original code as given, the user might not have imported 'string'. Oh! There's a mistake here. Let me check the initial code again.\\n\\nLooking at the code provided by the user:\\n\\nThe code they provided is:\\n\\ndef generate_secure_key(key_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Using weak pseudo-random number generator (vulnerable code)\\n    import random\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=key_length))\\n\\nBut they don't have an import for the 'string' module. Wait, that's an error in the code. Because 'string' is being referenced, but not imported. So the original code would actually raise a NameError because string is not imported. Hmm, but the user probably intended to have that. So in their actual code, maybe they imported string at the top. But in the code snippet provided by the user, there's no import statement. However, since the user included that line, the fix might need to include fixing that as well. But according to the Bandit analysis, the error is on line 8 where random.choices is used. The rest may be a different issue, but since the prompt is to fix the vulnerabilities found by Bandit (which is the B311:blacklist issue), the main fix is replacing random.choices with a secure alternative.\\n\\nBut regardless, the original code would also need 'import string', but the user's code probably just omitted that for brevity. So when providing the fix, that's not part of the problem. So the first problem is the use of random.choices.\\n\\nSo, in the fixed code, replace random with secrets. To do that, we need to import secrets. But the original code had an import random inside the function. That's allowed but bad practice, as per PEP8. However, for the purposes of fixing the vulnerability, replacing random with secrets is the key.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would be:\\n\\nFirst, import secrets (either inside or outside). Let's think: the original code imported random inside the function. So to replace, but maybe they should import secrets. But in any case, the function needs to use the secrets module.\\n\\nSo here's the step-by-step plan:\\n\\n1. Replace 'random.choices' with 'secrets' based selection.\\n\\nAs secrets doesn't have a 'choices' function with k parameter. So instead, construct the key by making a list of characters selected via secrets.choice.\\n\\nThus, the line return ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=key_length)) should be changed. So, for a key_length of n, select n characters using secrets.choice each time.\\n\\nSo the corrected line would be ''.join([secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(key_length)]).\\n\\nAlso, need to import the secrets module. So, probably, inside the function, but given that the original code had an import random inside the function, maybe the code should import secrets instead. Alternatively, import secrets at the top.\\n\\nBut in the code given by the user, the function doesn't import secrets. Let's structure the fixed code as follows:\\n\\nChange 'import random' into 'import secrets' inside the function. No, wait, the original code had 'import random' after the def statement.\\n\\nWait, wait, the original code has:\\n\\ndef generate_secure_key(...):\\n    import random\\n    characters = ...\\n\\nBut that's a code style issue; imports should usually be at the top. However, in the code given by the user, that's what was provided. However, in the fix, the code should replace random with secrets.\\n\\nBut since the code is supposed to generate a secure key, using secrets.choice.\\n\\nSo, the code: \\n\\nInside the function, perhaps after the imports, constructs the characters string.\\n\\nWait, but perhaps in the original code, 'string' isn't imported either. So in the code provided, string.ascii_letters would cause a name error. So the original code is also missing import string. That is a problem, but perhaps it's a copy-paste error from the user, and the actual code includes that import.\\n\\nBut for the purposes of the problem, the user provided that code as vulnerable, perhaps the function has the necessary import. So, the code after being fixed would need to have 'import string' as well. But given the code snippet provided, we don't see it. So, the user is responsible for that. But perhaps in the code, the 'string' module was imported somewhere else. But in our presented code snippet, the 'import string' is missing, but perhaps that's an oversight. Since the code snippet as presented would not run due to NameError on 'string'.\\n\\nBut that's a separate issue not caught by the Bandit analysis.\\n\\nSo the Bandit issue is about the use of random. The fix is to replace random.choices with secure functions. So the steps are:\\n\\n- Replace random.choices with a loop that calls secrets.choice each time.\\n\\nNow, let's code.\\n\\nSo, the corrected function would look like:\\n\\nimport secrets\\nimport string\\n\\ndef generate_secure_key(key_length: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(key_length))\\n\\nBut that's assuming imports are at the top. In the original code, 'import random' was inside the function. Wait, the original code had the 'import random' inside the function. But that's a code smell. It's more efficient to import modules at the top.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the fixer should also move the imports accordingly. But in any case, the vulnerability is due to the use of random. The Bandit report is about that.\\n\\nThus, the fix would involve:\\n\\n1. Import the secrets module (and the string module if necessary).\\n\\nBut the original code used string.ascii_letters, etc., which requires importing the string module.

I need to fix the vulnerabilities in this code based on the Bandit analysis results. First, looking at the XML issues. Bandit says using xml.etree.ElementTree is unsafe for untrusted data. The suggestion is to use defusedxml instead. So I should replace the import of xml.etree with defusedxml's ElementTree. Also, maybe call defuse_stdlib() to patch the standard library modules.\\n\\nIn the XML section, the code imports xml.etree.ElementTree as ET and uses ET.fromstring. I'll need to import defusedxml.ElementTree as ET instead. That would address both the B405 import issue and the B314 fromstring call. Also, perhaps ensure that defusedxml's version is used by modifying the code there.\\n\\nThen, the pickle issues. The reports B403 and B301 point out that using pickle to deserialize untrusted data is dangerous. The user wants to restrict deserialization to predefined secure formats, but pickle is inherently insecure here. So maybe remove support for pickle entirely. Because if the input can be untrusted, allowing pickle is a big security risk.\\n\\nWait, the original problem statement says to restrict deserialization to a predefined list of secure formats. So if the function is supposed to allow only secure formats, but the current code includes pickle which is not secure, then allowing 'pickle' as a format contradicts that requirement. Hence, the right fix is to remove 'pickle' as an option. Because the task says to ensure deserialization is restricted to a predefined list of secure formats. Since the default formats include pickle, which is not secure, the function should not handle pickle at all. So, removing the 'pickle' case entirely would fix those vulnerabilities. That would address the Bandit issues related to pickle.\\n\\nSo summarizing the steps:\\n\\n1. Replace xml.etree.ElementTree with defusedxml.ElementTree.\\n2. Remove the 'pickle' case, as it's unsafe.\\n3. Also, possibly call defusedxml.defuse_stdlib() to patch standard lib's XML modules, as further precaution.\\n\\nLet me check defusedxml's usage. The package defusedxml provides a safer alternative to the standard XML libraries. So in the XML case, the import should be 'from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse, fromstring' or similar. But since the code uses ET.fromstring, just importing defusedxml.ElementTree as ET should suffice, as it replaces the standard ET with their safe version.\\n\\nWait, when you import defusedxml.ElementTree, does it automatically patch the existing xml.etree.ElementTree? Or do you need to call defuse_stdlib()? The Bandit message mentions two options: replace with defusedxml or call defuse_stdlib.\\n\\nBut in the original code, they are using the standard xml.etree. The first Bandit issue is about importing xml.etree.ElementTree. So probably, replacing that import with defusedxml's version is better. So, changing the import line to 'import defusedxml.ElementTree as ET' might be the way. But then, when they call ET.fromstring, it uses the defused version.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the defusedxml's recommendation, which suggests replacing 'from xml.etree.ElementTree import parse' with 'from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse'.\\n\\nSo in the code:\\n\\nOriginal line for XML case:\\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\\n\\nChange to:\\nimport defusedxml.ElementTree as ET\\n\\nThat should fix both the B405 (import) and B314 (fromstring) issues.\\n\\nAs for pickle, given that the problem says to restrict deserialization to secure formats and input may come from untrusted entities, the function shouldn't allow using pickle at all. So removing the elif block for pickle is the safest approach. Hence, those lines will be deleted.\\n\\nNow, the function is supposed to accept a predefined list; so the user is already supposed to not allow pickle. Hence, the corrected code would only handle json and xml, with the latter using defusedxml.\\n\\nThen, adjusting the code accordingly.\\n\\nThe function will raise ValueError for any other format.\\n\\nPutting this all together.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider: The initial problem requires that deserialization is restricted to a predefined list of secure data formats. The original code includes json, xml, and pickle. Since pickle is insecure, it should be removed from the allowed list. Therefore, in the fixed code, serialization_format can only be \\\"json\\\" or \\\"xml\\\", and \\\"pickle\\\" is no longer an option. The code would raise ValueError if someone tries to pass 'pickle' as the format.\\n\\nSo, removing the entire 'pickle' block.\\n\\nSo the fixed code will:\\n\\n- For XML: Use defusedxml's ElementTree instead of the standard library.\\n- Remove the pickle handling.\\n\\nDone.

The problem is that exec can execute arbitrary code, which is dangerous. So, how do I safely execute the user's code while restricting it to safe operations?\\n\\nHmm, I remember that using exec in a restricted environment might help. Maybe using a dictionary to limit the globals and locals that the code can access. Like, providing a minimal set of allowed functions or modules.\\n\\nWait, the function needs to allow only safe operations. I should remove access to built-in functions and modules. Maybe override __builtins__ to be empty or None in the execution context. That way, the user code can't access dangerous functions.\\n\\nSo, create a restricted_globals dictionary. Set '__builtins__' to None or a controlled subset. That prevents accessing hazardous built-ins like os or subprocess.\\n\\nBut then, even with __builtins__ disabled, maybe the user can still do other harmful things. Like infinite loops or accessing memory? But the problem is mainly about unsafe operations, perhaps limiting what's imported.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the ast module to parse the code and check for allowed nodes. But that might be complicated. Since the task is to use exec but restrict it, I'll go with the restricted globals approach.\\n\\nSo in the exec function, pass the restricted_globals as both globals and locals. That way, the user code can't access any dangerous built-in functions. Only the allowed ones we provide.\\n\\nWait, but what if the user code tries to import modules? If __builtins__ is None, then import statements would raise an error. That's good because it prevents importing unsafe modules.\\n\\nSo, the revised code would have an exec statement with a custom globals dict that has __builtins__ set to None.

Setting __builtins__ to None removes access to any built-in functions, so the user can't execute unsafe code. But maybe they can still do some operations. Wait, even basic operations like print wouldn't work, but maybe that's acceptable since the problem states \\\"restrict to only safe operations.\\\" The intended use is probably to have custom allowed functions, but the original problem doesn't specify which operations are considered safe. So, the minimal approach is to disable all built-ins.\\n\\nHowever, even this might not be sufficient because there are other ways to execute code, but this reduces the attack surface.

The issue is that the current code uses the random module, which isn't cryptographically secure. Bandit flagged this as B311, indicating that standard pseudo-random generators aren't suitable for security purposes.\\n\\nSo the solution is to replace the random module with a more secure alternative. In Python, the 'secrets' module is designed for cryptographic purposes. Unlike random, secrets uses a more secure source of randomness, which is appropriate for things like passwords and security tokens.\\n\\nLooking at the original function, it uses random.choices to pick characters from the alphabet. The equivalent in secrets would be secrets.choice, but since choices allows specifying a k for multiple selections, I need to replicate that securely. However, the secrets module doesn't have a choices method. Instead, I can loop k times and select a random character each time using secrets.choice(alphabet). Alternatively, for each character in the key length, pick one character securely. So for size_of_key times, select a random element from the alphabet using secrets.choice, then join them all together.\\n\\nSo I'll replace 'random.choices(alphabet, k=size_of_key)' with a list comprehension that uses secrets.choice(alphabet) for each iteration up to size_of_key. Also, make sure to import the secrets module instead of random. Remove the import for random and add import secrets. Also, don't forget to import string since alphabet uses string.ascii_letters and digits.\\n\\nLet me check the syntax. Instead of using ''.join(random.choices(...)), it's ''.join([secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(size_of_key)]). Since secrets uses a secure PRNG under the hood, this should address the vulnerability mentioned by Bandit. \\n\\nDoes secrets module have any functions that generate a string directly? Well, secrets.token_urlsafe gives a random URL-safe string, but that might include characters not in the original alphabet. So sticking to the original approach where the alphabet is letters and digits is better because the user probably wants those specific characters. \\n\\nTherefore, the fixed function should import secrets and string, build the same alphabet, then generate each character using secrets.choice for the required key size.

The Bandit report says using eval is insecure and suggests using ast.literal_eval instead. Let me think about how that would work.\\n\\nEval can execute arbitrary code, which is a big security risk if the input comes from users. Replacing eval with ast.literal_eval might help because literal_eval only evaluates literals like strings, numbers, tuples, etc., not arbitrary code. But wait, the original function was meant to evaluate Python expressions like the user's query. If the quiz app allows mathematical expressions, maybe literal_eval can handle those.\\n\\nLet me check: if the user inputs something like \\\"2 + 3\\\", using literal_eval would throw an error because it's an expression, not a literal. So that's a problem. How to evaluate expressions safely? Maybe we need a different approach.\\n\\nHmm. Oh, right! Instead of using eval directly, maybe parse the expression using a safe evaluator. But how? Alternatively, we could restrict the allowed nodes in the AST before evaluating. That sounds complicated. Oh, but perhaps for the quiz app, the intended expressions are simple literals or math expressions without function calls or other dangerous constructs.\\n\\nWait, the original code just evaluates the expression and returns the result. So maybe the user's input is supposed to be mathematical, like \\\"5 * (3 + 2)\\\". If using literal_eval, that won't work because it's not a literal. So we can't directly replace eval with literal_eval here. This means that the original code is allowing arbitrary code execution, which is a problem.\\n\\nSo, the vulnerability here is using eval with user input. To fix it, we need a safe way to evaluate mathematical expressions. One possible way is to use a parser that only evaluates mathematical expressions, not arbitrary code. Like using a library such as asteval, or using a restricted environment for eval.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps using the operator module and a whitelist of allowed operations.\\n\\nHere's the approach I can take: create a dictionary of allowed functions and variables that eval can access, and then use that in a restricted environment. For example, whitelist only the necessary math functions and prevent access to builtins.\\n\\nSo, modify the eval call to use a custom namespace. Let's remove __builtins__ to limit access and only include safe math functions if needed.\\n\\nFor instance:\\n\\nallowed_globals = {'__builtins__': None}\\nallowed_locals = {'abs': abs, 'max': max, 'min': min, ...}  # if needed\\n\\nBut for a quiz app, maybe the expressions are simple arithmetic. In that case, maybe we can use a safe evaluator class that parses the expression and only evaluates mathematical operations.\\n\\nBut since the problem requires using the standard library, maybe we can use the ast module to parse the expression into an abstract syntax tree and check that it's only consisting of safe operations.\\n\\nWait, this would be more involved. How to do it?\\n\\nAlternatively, using a library like numexpr could be safe, but assuming the solution needs to rely on the standard library.\\n\\nAlternatively, wrap the eval in a context that restricts the builtins. So, by setting __builtins__ to None in the environment, the user can't call dangerous functions. Additionally, allow only specific functions or variables.\\n\\nSo, let's modify the code to use eval with a restricted environment. For example:\\n\\ndef process_user_expression(query_expr: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        # Restrict the globals to an empty namespace, no builtins\\n        result = eval(query_expr, {'__builtins__': None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut even this may not be safe, because if the query_expr contains something like (lambda: [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__())() ), then without builtins but certain other classes may still allow code execution. Wait, the problem is eval is a dangerous function unless you entirely sandbox it, which is very hard.\\n\\nBut according to the Bandit warning, they recommend using ast.literal_eval. So if the original use case is expecting a literal, like suppose the user enters expressions that evaluate to literals, then literal_eval is better.\\n\\nWait, the original problem statement says that the function should take a query string and evaluate it as a Python expression. So maybe the user's input is expected to be something like mathematical expressions, or data structures. But if using literal_eval, the query_expr has to be a literal.\\n\\nSo if the user inputs \\\"1 + 2\\\", ast.literal_eval will fail because that's not a literal, it's an expression. But eval(\\\"1 + 2\\\") gives 3. So in this case, replacing eval with ast.literal_eval breaks functionality if the input is an expression. But to fix the security problem, we need to avoid eval.\\n\\nHmm. There's a contradiction here. The problem's intended functionality requires evaluating expressions (like 1 + 2) but eval is unsafe, while ast.literal_eval cannot evaluate expressions.\\n\\nSo, perhaps the initial task was designed in a way that the user's queries are expected to be data literals (like {\\\"score\\\": 5}), but if the code currently uses eval, that allows code execution. To fix it, using ast.literal_eval would be correct, but that may depend on what QUIZAPP's specification says. Since the original problem says \\\"execute query-based evaluations\\\" with \\\"query string input\\\", maybe the query should be a boolean expression over some variables, but how are variables handled?\\n\\nI need to assume we should follow Bandit's recommendation. So I have to replace eval with ast.literal_eval. However, that would only parse literals. But maybe the user input needs to be a literal. For example, if the app expects the user to input something like \\\"42\\\" or \\\"[1, 2, 3]\\\", then literal_eval is safe. But in the original code, allowing any expression like \\\"exec('...')\\\" is a problem.\\n\\nIf the original function's intended use is to evaluate expressions, then using ast.literal_eval would not be sufficient. However, since the problem states that the Bandit report points to using eval as insecure, we are supposed to fix it. So perhaps the correct approach here is to use ast.literal_eval, even if that might change functionality, because eval is a vulnerability.\\n\\nBut then, would the code work for the intended purpose? For example, if the user inputs a mathematical expression like \\\"1 + 2 * 3\\\", using literal_eval would throw an error. So that may not be acceptable. Therefore, there is a conflict between security and functionality.\\n\\nIn the scenario where changing to literal_eval isn't possible, another approach is needed. So perhaps using a restricted subset of Python's syntax.\\n\\nAlternatively, another solution is to use a library like simpleeval (but that's not built-in) or to implement a safe evaluator.\\n\\nBut given the user's code must be fixed without dependencies, the next best thing is to create a minimal safe environment. For example, you can pass a custom globals dictionary to eval that doesn't include built-in functions or modules.\\n\\nTherefore, modifying the code to remove access to builtins:\\n\\ndef process_user_expression(query_expr: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        result = eval(query_expr, {\\\"__builtins__\\\": None}, {})\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nBut even this is not entirely safe. For example, someone might still access object attributes that could be harmful. For example, ().__class__.__base__ etc., leading to potential exploits.\\n\\nHowever, given the Bandit security report, this might not resolve the issue completely, but without more context, the main issue is using eval over ast.literal_eval. But the correct answer in this scenario, according to the Bandit report's suggestion, would be to replace eval with ast.literal_eval.\\n\\nBut wait, if we do that, then the function will fail on expressions, even simple ones like \\\"1 + 2\\\". Hence, the way the question is phrased is important: the original code uses eval to process the user query, which can be any Python expression. The Bandit report states that using eval is insecure. So the fix is to use ast.literal_eval. However, that would break the functionality if expressions are allowed, which suggests that the QUIZAPP requirements may need adjustment, but per the problem statement, we have to make the necessary correction.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that QUIZAPP executes query-based evaluations, which may be over data, so maybe the queries should be data literals. Assuming that, then replacing eval with ast.literal_eval makes sense.\\n\\nBut the original code uses eval and then returns the result as string. So the user's query_expr could be something that can't be parsed by literal_eval, like expressions. But the requirements may have implied that the input is a mathematical expression. So in that case, the solution required is to use ast.literal_eval, but then the code would break for expressions. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user input was supposed to be data literals only, and the use of eval was a mistake. Then switching to ast.literal_eval is correct.\\n\\nWithout further information on the application's intended handling of queries, the default answer to satisfy Bandit's warning and eliminate the vulnerability is to replace eval with ast.literal_eval. \\n\\nBut working with that, let's adjust the code.\\n\\nImport ast and use literal_eval.\\n\\nModified code:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\ndef process_user_expression(query_expr: str) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        result = ast.literal_eval(query_expr)\\n    except Exception:\\n        return \\\"Error!\\\"\\n    return str(result)\\n\\nThis would fix the vulnerability, but would only allow literals. However, if the requirement was to process any Python expression, this would change the functionality. But according to the problem statement, the Bandit report says to use ast.literal_eval, so this is the correct fix. The user may need to adjust their input to valid literals, which is safer.\\n\\nThus, the answer is to replace eval with ast.literal_eval and import ast.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":302,\"completion_tokens\":2207,\"total_tokens\":2509},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The user provided a code snippet that's vulnerable to shell injection according to Bandit's analysis. The issue is that they're using os.system with a command that's built using user-controlled input, which in this case is result_file. The command is constructed by formatting a string with result_file and the current directory.\\n\\nSo, the main vulnerability here is using a shell command with os.system. The Bandit warning B605 points out that starting a process with a shell can lead to injection attacks. That happens because if the result_file parameter has any malicious content, like semicolons or backticks, it could execute arbitrary commands.\\n\\nTo fix this, the best approach is to avoid using a shell altogether. Instead of using os.system, we should switch to using subprocess.run or similar functions that execute commands directly without invoking a shell. This way, arguments are passed safely without shell interpretation.\\n\\nLooking at the original code: command is a string like \\\"pigar gen -f [result_file] [current_dir]\\\", which is then executed via os.system. The problem is the use of a single string which is processed by the shell. We need to convert this into a list of arguments and use subprocess without shell=True.\\n\\nSo breaking down the parts:\\n- The command is \\\"pigar gen -f\\\" followed by the result_file path and the current directory.\\n\\nWe can split this into a list:\\n[\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", result_file, os.getcwd()]\\n\\nThen, use subprocess.run with this list, check the return code, and handle the exit code properly. Also, we need to capture the exit code and check if it's zero.\\n\\nBut wait, when using subprocess.run, the exit code is obtained from the CompletedProcess object's returncode attribute. So we can do something like:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run([pigar_path, ...], check=False)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nBut where is \\\"pigar\\\" located? When using subprocess like this, it relies on the PATH environment variable to find the executable. However, since the original code is using a module import (import pigar), perhaps pigar is a Python package that's supposed to be run as a module. Wait, pigar is a command-line tool. Hmm, maybe the user installed pigar and it's available as a command-line script. Or perhaps when you install pigar, you get a 'pigar' executable in the PATH.\\n\\nWait, maybe the original code's import pigar is not necessary? The code checks if pigar is installed but then proceeds to call it via the command line. So regardless, the function is trying to execute the 'pigar' command as a shell command. The problem is in how that command is constructed.\\n\\nIn the original code, the 'pigar' module is imported but not used. So the import is just to check if pigar is available, and then they shell out to the pigar command. But maybe the correct way is to use the module's functionality directly. However, assuming that changing to use the pigar library programmatically might be non-trivial, especially if the library's API isn't well-known, perhaps the best approach here is to fix the command execution.\\n\\nSo, since modifying to use the pigar library might require more extensive code changes which the user may not want, the next best thing is to replace the os.system call with a safer subprocess call.\\n\\nSo, avoid shell=True and pass the command as a list.\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\ncommand = f\\\"pigar gen -f {Path(result_file)} {os.getcwd()}\\\"\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\n\\nThe substitution would be:\\n\\nInstead of constructing a string, split into arguments:\\n\\nargs = [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(result_file)), os.getcwd()]\\n\\nThen, use subprocess.run, capture the exit code.\\n\\nBut then, the Path(result_file) may have spaces or other characters that the shell would handle, but using subprocess without shell=True will handle them correctly as a single argument.\\n\\nIn the original code, using os.getcwd() as part of the command suggests that pigar gen is told to scan the current working directory, and output to the result_file.\\n\\nSo the replacement would be:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(result_file)), os.getcwd()]).returncode\\n\\nBut I need to make sure that each argument is passed correctly.\\n\\nAdditionally, in some cases, Path(result_file) might be a relative path, but converting it to a string (using str()) should handle that.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe os.path.abspath(result_file) is better, but assuming the code uses Path(result_file), str() might be sufficient.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would import subprocess, replace the os.system line with subprocess.run, and not use shell=True.\\n\\nAdditionally, error handling remains the same: checking exit_code == 0.\\n\\nNow, the code would look like this:\\n\\nIn the import section, add import subprocess (if not already present; but original code does not have it, so need to include it).\\n\\nBut wait, in the original code, they have import pigar but in a try-except, and inside the function.\\n\\nWait, the code snippet starts with a function. At the beginning:\\n\\ndef find_dependencies(result_file: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Captures project dependencies and writes to a requirements file.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Retrieving project dependencies...\\\")\\n    try:\\n        import pigar\\n    except ModuleNotFoundError:\\n        logging.warning(\\n            \\\"pigar module is not installed, dependency retrieval may not be complete.\\\"\\n        )\\n        return\\n    command = f\\\"pigar gen -f {Path(result_file)} {os.getcwd()}\\\"\\n    # ... and so on.\\n\\nWait, but in the code, after importing pigar, they shell out to run the pigar command. That is, the import seems unnecessary except for checking that pigar is available. However, the code could be redundant. Because if pigar is not installed, this function returns after logging a warning, and hence the os.system('pigar gen ...') would not run. Wait, that's right. So in the code, they check that pigar is available (as a Python module) but then run the pigar command in the shell. But the availability of the module does not necessarily mean the command is available. That's a potential issue.\\n\\nBut regardless, the code is set up to run pigar via the command line. So the code's original logic first checks if the pigar Python module is imported, which may not fully represent whether the command-line tool is installed. But that's a separate issue. However, to fix the Bandit warning, the focus is on the shell command.\\n\\nSo to proceed: the fix is to replace the os.system(command) with subprocess.run() without shell=True.\\n\\nBut how?\\n\\nOriginal command: \\\"pigar gen -f {Path(result_file)} {os.getcwd()}\\\"\\n\\nThe shell splits this into parts: pigar, gen, -f, the result file path, the working directory.\\n\\nWhen converted to a list, that's:\\n\\ncommand_args = [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(result_file)), os.getcwd()]\\n\\nBut os.getcwd() returns the current directory as a string. So the code will generate the arguments correctly.\\n\\nThen, execute:\\n\\nprocess = subprocess.run(command_args)\\nexit_code = process.returncode\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(result_file)), os.getcwd()]).returncode\\n\\nBut need to make sure that Path(result_file) is correctly converted to a string. Also, using subprocess.run with these args without shell=True.\\n\\nSo modifying the original code accordingly:\\n\\nReplace the os.system(command) line with:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(result_file)), os.getcwd()]).returncode\\n\\nThat should eliminate the shell=True issue.\\n\\nBut wait, what if there are spaces or special characters in the result_file path? Using subprocess with a list will handle that correctly, as each argument is passed as separate, without shell parsing, so the command should be safe.\\n\\nTherefore, replacing os.system(command) with subprocess.run with the list-based arguments.\\n\\nAlso, need to import subprocess.\\n\\nWait, the original code imports os, Path from pathlib, but not subprocess. So in the function, after the try-except block for pigar, they need to import subprocess if not already imported. But since the code may have not imported subprocess at the top, we can assume that adding it as part of the code.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would include:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\n\\nWait, but in the original code, that would need to be imported in the function's scope. But imports should generally be at the top of the file, not inside function blocks unless necessary. However, the import pigar is inside the function. Anyway, the function is part of the code and to fix the vulnerability, changing how the command is executed.\\n\\nSo the final code would have:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(result_file)), os.getcwd()]).returncode\\n\\nBut wait, the original code logs the command before execution. But the command that's being logged is \\\"pigar gen -f ...\\\", and the actual execution is done via subprocess. So the log will show a string that's different from the actual execution. But in reality, when using subprocess with a list, the parameters are correctly split. So the logging here may now not match the actual command being executed, but this is a minor detail as logging can be adjusted.\\n\\nBut according to the original code, the logging line is:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\n\\nBut in the fixed code, command is the shell-command string, but in the code, we are not using the command variable anymore. Wait, that's an issue. Because the existing code constructs the 'command' as a string for logging purposes. But with the fix, the code is no longer using that command string. So the logging line would still show the shell command, which won't exactly match the way subprocess runs the command. However, to keep the logging accurate, perhaps we need to log the arguments differently. Or, we can adjust the logging to show the actual command that's being executed via subprocess.\\n\\nAlternatively, the logging line can remain as is, but the variable 'command' would now be generated as the list of arguments. But no, the original code logs the 'command' variable as a formatted string. To avoid confusion, we can generate the command string for logging purposes, even though in reality the subprocess uses the list.\\n\\nBut Bandit's warning is specifically about the use of os.system with a shell. So changing the code to use subprocess without shell=True and passing arguments as a list is the fix.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code would:\\n\\n1. Replace the os.system(command) line with subprocess.run using the list of arguments, without shell=True.\\n\\nBut we can keep the logging line as command = ... but actually, since the code is now using a list, that logging line would not be accurate. To handle that, possibly generate the command string for logging, but use the list for execution.\\n\\nWait, the original code constructs command as a string, logs it, then executes it. So to retain the logging, perhaps the code can build the command string, log it, but then parse it into a list. But that adds more complexity.\\n\\nAn alternative approach is to construct the list for subprocess, then log the command as a joined string.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\ncommand_args = [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(result_file)), os.getcwd()]\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", \\\" \\\".join(command_args))\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command_args).returncode\\n\\nThis way, the logged command is an approximate representation of the actual command executed. This might handle spaces and quoting automatically, but could be safer. In the original code, logging the command as a string would include any potentially unsafe characters, but not actually executing them in a shell.\\n\\nBut when using subprocess with a list, such arguments are passed directly to the process, so the logging as a joined string may not show correctly quoted arguments. For example, if the result_file contains spaces, the joined string would show the path without quotes, which would be not the same as the original shell command. However, the logging is for informational purposes, to indicate what is being run, not for actual execution. So this is acceptable.\\n\\nSo, the fixed function would:\\n\\n- Change the command_args from the shell command string to a list.\\n\\n- Log the joined string of the command arguments.\\n\\nBut then, perhaps we can adjust 'command' to be the joined string from the list. So the code becomes:\\n\\n...\\n\\n    command_args = [\\n        \\\"pigar\\\",\\n        \\\"gen\\\",\\n        \\\"-f\\\",\\n        str(Path(result_file)),\\n        os.getcwd()\\n    ]\\n    command = \\\" \\\".join(command_args)\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\n    exit_code = subprocess.run(command_args).returncode\\n\\nBut then, logging the command as a string, even though when run via subprocess as a list, so the log reflects the approximate command.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that the log line shows the same command that's being run, even if it's not via a shell.\\n\\nBut another issue: What if one of the arguments contains spaces? For example, if the result_file's path has a space, the shell command would require quotes around it, but when using the list in subprocess, quotes are not needed. So the logged command would have the path with spaces, but not enclosed in quotes. However, if someone copy-pastes that logged command into a shell, it would not work properly. But that's a separate concern since the logging here is only for information. The actual execution uses the list, which ensures proper handling.\\n\\nIn summary, the vulnerable line is using os.system with a shell. To fix it, switch to subprocess.run without shell=True and use a list of arguments. The fixed code would structure the command as a list, construct it properly, log the command as a joined string, and execute with subprocess.run.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code for the function is:\\n\\ndef find_dependencies(result_file: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Captures project dependencies and writes them to a requirements file.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Retrieving project dependencies...\\\")\\n    try:\\n        import pigar\\n    except ModuleNotFoundError:\\n        logging.warning(\\n            \\\"pigar module is not installed, dependency retrieval may not be complete.\\\"\\n        )\\n        return\\n    result_file_path = str(Path(result_file))\\n    command_args = [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", result_file_path, os.getcwd()]\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", \\\" \\\".join(command_args))\\n    exit_code = subprocess.run(command_args).returncode\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Dependencies retrieved successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to retrieve dependencies; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n\\nBut wait, in the code, the original Path(result_file) was formatted into the command. So str(Path(result_file)) is just resolving the path but the result is the same as result_file passed via the function? Well, perhaps using os.path.abspath(result_file) could be better, but the original code uses Path(result_file), and converting to a string to pass as an argument.\\n\\nWait, the original code uses f\\\"{Path(result_file)}\\\", which would stringify the Path object. So, in the fixed code, result_file_path is correctly formed.\\n\\nAdditionally, as per best practices, perhaps we should check if the Path(result_file) is an absolute path, but that's beyond the current vulnerability fix.\\n\\nThus, the final code uses subprocess with arguments as a list, replacing os.system, to avoid shell injection.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":426,\"completion_tokens\":3556,\"total_tokens\":3982},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The issue is that using eval here can allow code injection attacks. The Bandit report points that out and suggests using ast.literal_eval, but I'm not sure that's the right approach here because the WHERE clause might involve expressions that need to evaluate conditions dynamically. Wait, actually, the problem is executing arbitrary code through eval. So maybe instead of using eval, I should parse the WHERE conditions in a safer way.\\n\\nHmm, the WHERE conditions are split by 'AND'. So each condition is a logical expression, perhaps like 'age \\u003e 30' or 'name == \\\"Alice\\\"'. The current code is taking these strings and joining them with 'and', then evaluating them in the context of the item dictionary. But eval is dangerous here because if the where_conditions contain malicious code, it could execute arbitrary commands.\\n\\nTo fix this, I need to replace the eval with a safer method. Instead of dynamically evaluating the conditions, I should parse each condition and compare the item's fields without executing code. For example, each condition could be something like \\\"field operator value\\\", and I can parse each part and check against the item's data.\\n\\nSo for each condition in where_conditions, split it into the field, operator, and value. Then create a comparison function that checks the condition against each item. That way, there's no use of eval, making it safer.\\n\\nLet me think about how to parse a condition like 'age \\u003e 30' into field 'age', operator '\\u003e', and value 30. Then, compare item['age'] \\u003e 30. But how to handle different operators like ==, !=, \\u003c, \\u003c=, etc.?\\n\\nI can create a helper function that takes the condition string, splits it into parts, and uses a dictionary to map operators to the corresponding comparison functions.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\ndef evaluate_condition(item, condition):\\n    # Split the condition into parts. This might be tricky if the value has spaces.\\n    # For simplicity, maybe assume the condition is in the format \\\"field operator value\\\" with spaces only around the operator.\\n    operators = ['==', '!=', '\\u003e=', '\\u003c=', '\\u003e', '\\u003c']\\n    for op in operators:\\n        if op in condition:\\n            field, rest = condition.split(op, 1)\\n            field = field.strip()\\n            value = rest.strip()\\n            actual_value = item.get(field)\\n            # Now parse the value correctly, considering possible data types like numbers or strings\\n            # Convert value from string to appropriate type\\n            try:\\n                parsed_value = ast.literal_eval(value)\\n            except:\\n                parsed_value = value  # fallback to string if parsing fails\\n            if op == '==':\\n                return actual_value == parsed_value\\n            elif op == '!=':\\n                return actual_value != parsed_value\\n            elif op == '\\u003e=':\\n                return actual_value \\u003e= parsed_value\\n            elif op == '\\u003c=':\\n                return actual_value \\u003c= parsed_value\\n            elif op == '\\u003e':\\n                return actual_value \\u003e parsed_value\\n            elif op == '\\u003c':\\n                return actual_value \\u003c parsed_value\\n    # If no operator found, assume equality check with possible = sign\\n    if '=' in condition:\\n        field, value = condition.split('=', 1)\\n        field = field.strip()\\n        value = value.strip()\\n        parsed_value = ast.literal_eval(value)\\n        return item.get(field) == parsed_value\\n    # If none, perhaps raise an error?\\n    raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid condition: {condition}\\\")\\n\\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Another approach would be to use a regex to capture the field, operator, and value. For example:\\n\\nimport re\\npattern = r\\\"^\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003e=|\\u003c=|\\u003e|\\u003c)\\\\s*(\\\\S+)\\\\s*$\\\"\\n\\nThen match each condition against this pattern. For each match, get field, operator, value, then parse the value correctly.\\n\\nWait, but the value in the condition could be a string with quotes, like \\\"name == 'John'\\\". So perhaps I need to handle quoted strings as values.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the WHERE conditions are expected to be in the form \\\"field OP value\\\" where OP is an operator, and value is either a number or a string enclosed in quotes.\\n\\nParsing these conditions properly would be necessary. Then for each item in the dataset, check all conditions by evaluating the operator against the item's field value and the parsed value.\\n\\nThis approach would eliminate the need for eval, making it safe.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\n1. For each where_condition in where_conditions, parse into field, operator, value.\\n\\n2. For each parsed condition, check if the item's field meets the operator's condition against the parsed value.\\n\\nSo, replace the line where filter_func uses eval with a function that checks each parsed condition.\\n\\nTherefore, in the code, the line\\n\\nfilter_func = lambda item: eval(' and '.join(where_conditions), item)\\n\\nneeds to be replaced with a function that uses the parsed conditions.\\n\\nSo, first, parse all the conditions:\\n\\nconditions = []\\nfor condition in where_conditions:\\n    parts = re.split(r\\\"\\\\s+\\\", condition.strip())\\n    # Maybe a better regex here to capture field, operator, value.\\n    # Let's try a regex pattern that splits the condition into parts.\\n    # Whatever the operator is, split on that. Hmm, maybe:\\n\\n    regex = re.compile(r\\\"(\\\\w+)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003e=|\\u003c=|\\u003e|\\u003c)\\\\s*(.*)\\\")\\n    match = regex.match(condition.strip())\\n    if not match:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid WHERE condition: {condition}\\\")\\n\\n    field, operator, value_str = match.groups()\\n    # Need to parse the value_str, which could be a number or a string.\\n    try:\\n        value = ast.literal_eval(value_str)\\n    except:\\n        # If it's a string without quotes, treat as string?\\n        value = value_str\\n\\n    conditions.append( (field, operator, value) )\\n\\nThen, the filter function would check each condition.\\n\\nFor the filter_func, use a lambda that checks all conditions.\\n\\nBut perhaps:\\n\\ndef filter_func(item):\\n    for field, operator, value in conditions:\\n        item_value = item.get(field)\\n        # handle each operator\\n        if operator == '==' and item_value != value:\\n            return False\\n        elif operator == '!=' and item_value == value:\\n            return False\\n        elif operator == '\\u003e=' and item_value \\u003c value:\\n            return False\\n        elif operator == '\\u003c=' and item_value \\u003e value:\\n            return False\\n        elif operator == '\\u003e' and item_value \\u003c= value:\\n            return False\\n        elif operator == '\\u003c' and item_value \\u003e= value:\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\nBut wait, perhaps more precisely:\\n\\nFor each condition in conditions:\\n\\nresult = True\\n\\nfor (field, op, val) in conditions:\\n    actual_val = item.get(field)\\n    if op == '==':\\n        res = (actual_val == val)\\n    elif op == '!=':\\n        res = (actual_val != val)\\n    elif op == '\\u003e=':\\n        res = (actual_val \\u003e= val)\\n    elif op == '\\u003c=':\\n        res = (actual_val \\u003c= val)\\n    elif op == '\\u003e':\\n        res = (actual_val \\u003e val)\\n    elif op == '\\u003c':\\n        res = (actual_val \\u003c val)\\n    else:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unknown operator: {op}\\\")\\n\\n    if not res:\\n        return False\\n\\nreturn True\\n\\nSo combining all conditions with AND logic.\\n\\nTherefore, the code will parse each WHERE condition into parts, and then check each of them in the filter function.\\n\\nSo replacing the vulnerable eval line with this logic should fix the code injection vulnerability.\\n\\nNow, need to integrate this into the original code.\\n\\nFirst, import ast and re if not already imported. Wait, the original code may or may not have the imports, but I think in the given code, 're' is used, so it must have the import.\\n\\nSo first, we need to parse the where_conditions into the list of tuples as (field, operator, value).\\n\\nThen the filter_func would loop through each of these tuples and check each condition.\\n\\nSo modifying the original code as follows:\\n\\nOriginal line:\\n\\nfilter_func = lambda item: eval(' and '.join(where_conditions), item)\\n\\nReplace that with:\\n\\nconditions = []\\n\\nfor cond in where_conditions:\\n    # Process each individual condition in where_conditions\\n    cond = cond.strip()\\n    if not cond:\\n        continue\\n\\n    # Use regex to split into field, operator, value\\n    # Handling conditions like \\\"field\\u003e=value\\\" with optional whitespace\\n    # Regex pattern that can capture these elements\\n    pattern = r\\\"^\\\\s*([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003e=|\\u003c=|\\u003e|\\u003c)\\\\s*(.*?)\\\\s*$\\\"\\n    match = re.match(pattern, cond)\\n    if not match:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid WHERE condition: {cond}\\\")\\n\\n    field, op, val_str = match.groups()\\n\\n    # Parse the value, handling strings (quoted) and other literals\\n    try:\\n        # Handle cases where value is a string in quotes: 'value' or \\\"value\\\"\\n        if (val_str.startswith(\\\"'\\\") and val_str.endswith(\\\"'\\\")) or (val_str.startswith('\\\"') and val_str.endswith('\\\"')):\\n            val = val_str[1:-1]\\n        else:\\n            val = ast.literal_eval(val_str)\\n    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):\\n        # Fallback to treating the value as a string if parsing fails\\n        val = val_str\\n\\n    conditions.append( (field, op, val) )\\n\\n# Define the filter function without eval\\ndef filter_func(item):\\n    for (field, op, val) in conditions:\\n        item_val = item.get(field)\\n        if op == '==':\\n            if item_val != val:\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '!=':\\n            if item_val == val:\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '\\u003e=':\\n            if not (item_val \\u003e= val):\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '\\u003c=':\\n            if not (item_val \\u003c= val):\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '\\u003e':\\n            if not (item_val \\u003e val):\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '\\u003c':\\n            if not (item_val \\u003c val):\\n                return False\\n        else:\\n            raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator: {op}\\\")\\n    return True\\n\\nBut then the original code's filter_func is used in 'filter'. So in the current code:\\n\\nresult = filter(filter_func, dataset_list)\\n\\nBut the original code's lambda was part of the code. So in the code, the part after 'where_conditions' is parsed, and then the conditions are built.\\n\\nBut within the function, how to handle that? Let's re-structure the code.\\n\\nSo, in the original code, between processing the WHERE clause and the ORDER BY, we need to:\\n\\n- Process each where condition into (field, operator, value)\\n\\nThen create a filtering function that checks all these conditions.\\n\\nSo the revised code would replace the original line:\\n\\nfilter_func = lambda item: eval(' and '.join(where_conditions), item)\\n\\nWith the code to parse conditions and define filter_func.\\n\\nSo integrating this into the function execute_query_cmd.\\n\\nBut, in the original code, try-block starts, and here's the original structure:\\n\\nInside try:\\n\\n    parse the query using re.match to get select_clause, where_clause, order_by_clause.\\n\\n    process select_fields.\\n\\n    process where_conditions as split by 'AND'.\\n\\n    create filter_func using eval.\\n\\n    process order_by.\\n\\nBut now, the corrected code would need to process the where_conditions into parsed conditions and then use a custom filter function.\\n\\nSo the revised code for the function 'execute_query_cmd':\\n\\nInside the try:\\n\\nafter splitting where_conditions into parts (split by 'AND'), process each part.\\n\\nFirst, collect all the conditions by parsing each condition.\\n\\nconditions = []\\nfor cond in where_conditions:\\n    cond = cond.strip()\\n    if not cond:\\n        continue\\n\\n    # Match the pattern to separate field, operator, value\\n    regex = re.compile(r\\\"^\\\\s*([a-zA-Z_]\\\\w*)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003e=|\\u003c=|\\u003e|\\u003c)\\\\s*(.*?)\\\\s*$\\\")\\n    match = regex.match(cond)\\n    if not match:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid WHERE condition: {cond}\\\")\\n\\n    field, operator, value_str = match.groups()\\n\\n    # Parse the value_str into a Python object, handling strings and other types\\n    # Check if the value is quoted\\n    value = value_str\\n    if (value_str.startswith(\\\"'\\\") and value_str.endswith(\\\"'\\\")) or (value_str.startswith('\\\"') and value_str.endswith('\\\"')):\\n        value = value_str[1:-1]\\n    else:\\n        try:\\n            # Use ast.literal_eval to safely parse numbers, booleans, etc.\\n            value = ast.literal_eval(value_str)\\n        except:\\n            # If parsing fails, keep as a string (this might be invalid, but proceed)\\n            pass\\n\\n    conditions.append( (field, operator, value) )\\n\\n# Then, the filter function checks these conditions\\ndef filter_func(item):\\n    for (field, op, val) in conditions:\\n        item_val = item.get(field)\\n        # Get the actual value from the item\\n        # Compare based on operator\\n        if op == '==':\\n            if item_val != val:\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '!=':\\n            if item_val == val:\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '\\u003e=':\\n            if item_val \\u003c val:\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '\\u003c=':\\n            if item_val \\u003e val:\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '\\u003e':\\n            if item_val \\u003c= val:\\n                return False\\n        elif op == '\\u003c':\\n            if item_val \\u003e= val:\\n                return False\\n        else:\\n            # Invalid operator, raise error\\n            raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator in WHERE clause: {op}\\\")\\n    return True\\n\\nNow, using this filter_func which explicitly checks each parsed condition without using eval.\\n\\nSo replacing the existing line where filter_func is created with the above code.\\n\\nThat should eliminate the use of eval, thereby addressing the Bandit vulnerability.\\n\\nAdditionally, handle quotation marks in strings by checking if the value_str is enclosed in quotes.\\n\\nTesting some examples:\\n\\nFor example, if the where clause is \\\"name == 'Alice'\\\", the parsed value would be 'Alice' (without quotes). Similarly, if the clause is \\\"age \\u003e 30\\\", the value is parsed as integer 30.\\n\\nThis way, even if the input includes something like \\\"1 == 1; import os; os.system('rm -rf /')\\\", the split would attempt to parse each condition, but the regex would not match an invalid operator, raising ValueError. Thus, the code is safe from injection.\\n\\nNow, modifying the original code accordingly.\\n\\nMake sure that the code includes necessary imports. The original code might need 'import re', and we need 'import ast' for the literal_eval, but in Bandit report there was an issue with eval, but in the corrected code, we aren't using eval anymore.\\n\\nBut wait, the code as corrected uses ast.literal_eval to parse the value in the where condition. Since we are using literal_eval on the value_str (after surrounding quotes are stripped), which is safe because literal_eval is secure.\\n\\nNow, integrating these steps into the original code:\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\n        # Process WHERE clause\\n        where_conditions = where_clause.split('AND')\\n        # WARNING: This is vulnerable to code injection\\n        filter_func = lambda item: eval(' and '.join(where_conditions), item)\\n        # Process ORDER BY clause\\n\\nReplace with:\\n\\n        # Process WHERE clause\\n        where_conditions = [cond.strip() for cond in where_clause.split('AND') if cond.strip()]\\n        conditions = []\\n        for cond in where_conditions:\\n            # Match field, operator, value\\n            match_condition = re.match(r\\\"^\\\\s*([a-zA-Z_]\\\\w*)\\\\s*(==|!=|\\u003e=|\\u003c=|\\u003e|\\u003c)\\\\s*(.*?)\\\\s*$\\\", cond)\\n            if not match_condition:\\n                raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid WHERE condition: {cond}\\\")\\n            field, op, val_str = match_condition.groups()\\n            # Parse value\\n            if (val_str.startswith(\\\"'\\\") and val_str.endswith(\\\"'\\\")) or (val_str.startswith('\\\"') and val_str.endswith('\\\"')):\\n                # Strip quotes\\n                parsed_val = val_str[1:-1]\\n            else:\\n                try:\\n                    parsed_val = ast.literal_eval(val_str)\\n                except (ValueError, SyntaxError):\\n                    # Treat as string if parsing fails (might raise error during filtering)\\n                    parsed_val = val_str\\n            conditions.append( (field, op, parsed_val) )\\n        \\n        def filter_func(item):\\n            for field, op, val in conditions:\\n                item_val = item.get(field)\\n                try:\\n                    if op == '==':\\n                        if item_val != val:\\n                            return False\\n                    elif op == '!=':\\n                        if item_val == val:\\n                            return False\\n                    elif op == '\\u003e=':\\n                        if not (item_val \\u003e= val):\\n                            return False\\n                    elif op == '\\u003c=':\\n                        if not (item_val \\u003c= val):\\n                            return False\\n                    elif op == '\\u003e':\\n                        if not (item_val \\u003e val):\\n                            return False\\n                    elif op == '\\u003c':\\n                        if not (item_val \\u003c val):\\n                            return False\\n                    else:\\n                        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported operator: {op}\\\")\\n                except TypeError:\\n                    # Handle cases where comparison fails (e.g., different types)\\n                    return False\\n            return True\\n\\nThis should properly handle each condition. Now, in case a value can't be parsed (like a string without quotes that is not a literal), but in such cases, we may have errors during filtering. Also, comparisons with mismatched types will return False (hence filtered out). But the code will be safe from injection.\\n\\nTesting code examples:\\n\\nPossible input SQL query: SELECT name, age FROM data WHERE age \\u003e 25 AND name == 'Alice' ORDER BY age\\n\\nIn this case, the where conditions are split into ['age \\u003e 25', \\\"name == 'Alice'\\\"], parsed into ('age', '\\u003e', 25) and ('name', '==', 'Alice'). The filter_func checks if the item's age is greater than 25 and name is 'Alice'.\\n\\nAnother possible query: SELECT * FROM data WHERE invalid_field == \\\"something\\\" OR 1=1;--\\n\\nBut first, the regex splitting on the where_clause will split into ['invalid_field == \\\"something\\\" OR 1=1;--'] maybe. Wait, the split is done on 'AND', so the original code before WHERE_clause splitting splits using 'AND'. Oh right, the original code splits on 'AND' because it's part of the query structure. So if a WHERE clause contains 'OR', it's considered a single condition, which may not be correctly parsed.

The problem is that it's using the random module, which isn't secure for cryptographic purposes. Bandit pointed out that using a weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) like random is a security risk.\\n\\nThe original code uses random.choices to pick characters from an alphabet and generate a string. Random's functions aren't cryptographically secure, so someone might predict the generated tokens, making the reset key vulnerable to attacks.\\n\\nThe right approach here is to switch to a secure random number generator. In Python, the 'secrets' module is designed for security-sensitive operations like this. The secrets module uses a cryptographically strong PRNG, so it's much safer.\\n\\nLet me replace the random.choices with secrets.choice. But wait, how do I generate a string of the given size? Oh right, for each character, I can use secrets.choice(alphabet), and do that 'size' times.\\n\\nSo instead of using random.choices which selects multiple at once, I'll loop 'size' times and each time pick a character using secrets.choice from the alphabet. Alternatively, I could generate a random string using a generator expression with secrets.choice.\\n\\nWait, another way: since secrets has a function called token_urlsafe, but that uses base64 encoding and may not fit exactly the alphabet requested here (letters and digits). The user probably wants exactly the characters in the alphabet (letters and digits) without any special characters.\\n\\nTherefore, the safest way is to select each character using secrets.choice from the given alphabet string, and join the selected characters together.\\n\\nSo here's the plan: import secrets and string. Then, create the alphabet as letters + digits. Then, use a list comprehension or generator expression that runs for 'size' times, each time selecting a random character from alphabet via secrets.choice. Then join them into a string.\\n\\nModify the original code: replace random with secrets, remove the import random, add import secrets. Let's check the code.\\n\\nOriginal function:\\n\\nimport random (inside the function, which is not great practice either, but maybe for minimal change?)\\n\\nWait, the original code imports random inside the function. But in the fixed code, we need to import secrets. Alternatively, import outside.\\n\\nBut the original function's structure:\\n\\ndef create_reset_key(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    import random  # here's the import\\n    ... uses random.choices ...\\n\\nBut importing inside a function is unusual but not prohibited. For secrets, better to import at the top. However, for minimal changes, perhaps just replace random.choices with secrets.SystemRandom().choices? Wait, wait. Another approach is to use the SystemRandom class from random, which is also secure. Wait, but according to the Python docs, the SystemRandom class uses os.urandom under the hood, which is suitable for cryptographic use.\\n\\nSo, alternatively, instead of replacing random with secrets, we could use SystemRandom like:\\n\\nfrom random import SystemRandom\\n\\nsecure_random = SystemRandom()\\nreturn ''.join(secure_random.choices(alphabet, k=size))\\n\\nBut in that case, maybe using secrets module is better and more straightforward. Let me check the recommendations.\\n\\nThe Python documentation says that the secrets module is preferred over random.SystemRandom because it's designed specifically for security. Secrets uses SystemRandom under the hood, but provides convenience functions.\\n\\nBut the existing code uses random.choices. If I wanted to make minimal changes, perhaps create a SystemRandom instance. Let's consider that.\\n\\nOriginal code has:\\n\\nreturn ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=size))\\n\\nChanging that to using a secure source would be:\\n\\nsecure_rng = random.SystemRandom()\\nreturn ''.join(secure_rng.choices(alphabet, k=size))\\n\\nBut that would require importing random, and using the SystemRandom class. Alternatively, switch to the secrets module, which is a better approach.\\n\\nThe secrets module has no 'choices' function. But we can use secrets.choice() in a loop. So, for example:\\n\\nfrom secrets import choice\\n\\nalphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\nreturn ''.join( choice(alphabet) for _ in range(size) )\\n\\nThat should generate a secure token. Each character is chosen using a secure random selection.\\n\\nSo modifying the code:\\n\\nOriginal:\\n\\ndef create_reset_key(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG\\n    import random\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=size))\\n\\nChange to:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef create_reset_key(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(size))\\n\\nWait, why is there an import of string inside the original function? No, in the original code, it's 'import random' inside the function, but alphabet uses string.ascii_letters, which requires that the string module is imported. However, in the original code, if string is not imported elsewhere, it would produce an error. Wait, actually, the original code may be missing an import statement for string. Looking at the vulnerable code snippet:\\n\\nThe original code is as follows:\\n\\ndef create_reset_key(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    # Vulnerable: Weak PRNG\\n    import random\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(random.choices(alphabet, k=size))\\n\\nWait, here, they reference string.ascii_letters and string.digits. But the 'string' module isn't imported. So there should be an error. That must be a mistake in the given code. So the correct code would require importing the string module. So, that's another bug. But since the user provided that code, probably in their actual code they have string imported, maybe it's missing from the code because it was not included in the snippet. So the fixed code should also import string.\\n\\nOriginal code may have an import missing. But based on Bandit's analysis, the actual code (which the user has) probably has the necessary imports. The Bandit result only flags the random.choices line.\\n\\nSo the corrected code needs to import string, secrets, and replace the random with secrets.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected function would be:\\n\\nImport the necessary modules, switch to using secrets.choice in a list comprehension or generator expression, and construct the string.\\n\\nSo the fixed code:\\n\\nimport string\\nimport secrets\\n\\ndef create_reset_key(size: int) -\\u003e str:\\n    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\\n    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(size))\\n\\nNote that the 'secrets' module needs to be imported, and we use secrets.choice() each time.\\n\\nTherefore, that's the secure version. That way, each character is chosen using a cryptographically secure method.\\n\\nEven though generating a string with multiple calls to secrets.choice (once per character) may not be as efficient as generating all the bytes at once, it is secure. For security-sensitive tokens like password reset keys, this approach is recommended to ensure each character is randomly selected with high entropy.\\n\\nTherefore, this should resolve the B311 warning from Bandit.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":324,\"completion_tokens\":1559,\"total_tokens\":1883},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The issue is using os.system with a shell command, which can lead to command injection. Let me look at the original code.\\n\\nThe function purge_files is using os.system to run \\\"rm *.ext\\\" in a directory. The problem is constructing the command as a string and using os.system, which invokes a shell. If ext_type or dir_path has untrusted input, someone could inject commands. Like if ext_type is \\\"txt; rm -rf /\\\", that's bad.\\n\\nSo, the fix is to avoid using the shell. Instead of using os.system, I can use the subprocess module with a list of arguments. Also, using Python's built-in path handling would be better.\\n\\nWait, maybe there's a way without even executing external commands. The code is deleting files matching an extension in a directory. Why not use Python's os or pathlib to list the files and delete them one by one?\\n\\nLet me think. Using glob.glob to find all files ending with .ext in dir_path, then loop over them and delete each using os.remove. That way, there's no shell involved, which eliminates the injection risk entirely.\\n\\nSo here's the plan:\\n\\n1. Check if the directory exists. The existing code does that with Path(dir_path).exists().\\n2. Use glob to find all files matching the pattern: os.path.join(dir_path, f'*.{ext_type}')\\n3. For each matching file, check if it's a file (in case there are directories with the same extension), then os.unlink it.\\n4. Handle exceptions if needed? The original code didn't, maybe the logger can catch errors.\\n\\nThis approach removes the need for any shell commands, thus fixing the vulnerability. Let's adjust the code accordingly.\\n\\nSo replacing the command with:\\n\\nfiles_to_delete = Path(dir_path).glob(f'*.{ext_type}')\\n\\nThen loop through those files. Also, need to resolve any path traversal issues, but since the directory is specified and the glob is relative, maybe that's okay.\\n\\nWait, but what if the ext_type has something like \\\"../\\\" or other tricks? But if ext_type is validated as an extension, perhaps, but the function parameters allow any string for ext_type. So maybe sanitize ext_type to prevent directory traversal in the pattern. For example, ensuring that the extension doesn't contain slashes. But the original code uses os.path.join(dir_path, f'*.{ext_type}'), and Path.glob would handle patterns safely as well.\\n\\nBut another thing, when constructing the path with ext_type, how to prevent someone from passing an extension with characters like \\\"/\\\". For example, if ext_type is \\\"foo/../bar\\\", the glob pattern becomes *.foo/../bar, which might not be intended. So the code should sanitize the ext_type. But the original code didn't do that. Since this is part of the vulnerability fix, adding a check to ensure ext_type is valid.\\n\\nAlternatively, since ext_type is supposed to be a file extension, maybe it's safer to split on the last '.' and take the extension, but perhaps not. The user of the function is supposed to pass a valid extension, but maybe better to escape the ext_type.\\n\\nHmm. For security, the function should sanitize the ext_type. So check that ext_type doesn't contain any characters that could alter the path. Like, it should only contain alphanumeric and maybe certain allowed characters. But since the function allows ext_type to be any string, how to prevent that? Maybe using a whitelist for allowed characters in the extension. But perhaps that's beyond the scope here. The main vulnerability is the shell injection. However, even in the Python code, if the ext_type has a '/' in it, then the glob pattern might end up in a different directory. Wait: When constructing the path as Path(dir_path).glob(f'*.{ext_type}'), the *.ext_type is being joined to the dir_path. For example, dir_path is '/safe_dir', and ext_type is 'txt; blah', then the glob would look for files in /safe_dir matching *.txt; blah. The asterisk is in the filename part. Pathlib's glob should not allow escaping the directory since it appends the pattern. Even if ext_type is \\\"../something\\\", Path(dir_path).glob(f'*.{ext_type}') would resolve to dir_path + \\\"*.ext_type\\\", which, if ext_type is '../.txt', would be something like dir_path/*../.txt. Not sure. Maybe Pathlib handles that by normalizing the path. But it's safer to enforce that the extension does not contain path separators.\\n\\nSo, to make this safe, sanitize the ext_type to ensure it doesn't have any directory components. For example:\\n\\nif '/' in ext_type or '\\\\\\\\' in ext_type:\\n    raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid extension type.\\\")\\n\\nBut the function doesn't check that. So, adding a check for any path separator characters in ext_type to prevent path traversal via the extension.\\n\\nAlternatively, split the ext_type and use only the last part, but I think the intended behavior is that ext_type is a plain extension, not containing any path separators. Therefore, adding a check:\\n\\nif not ext_type.isalnum():  # Or another check\\n\\nBut maybe the extension can contain underscores, etc. So perhaps check that ext_type doesn't contain any of the prohibited characters, like /, \\\\, etc.\\n\\nBut perhaps, given the function's responsibility, it's the caller's job to provide a valid extension. However, as a secure function, it's better to have the function validate the input. So, let's add:\\n\\nimport re\\n...\\nif not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$', ext_type):\\n    raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid extension type.\\\")\\n\\nBut maybe that's being too restrictive. But it's just an example. However, since the original code didn't have this check, adding it would make it more secure.\\n\\nBut the primary Bandit issue is the shell injection, so the main fix is to replace os.system with a method that doesn't use the shell, such as handling the file deletion in Python.\\n\\nSo, putting this together: remove the command-line call to rm, use Pathlib to find and delete the files.\\n\\nSo revised code:\\n\\ndef purge_files(dir_path: str, ext_type: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Deletes all files with the specified extension in the given directory.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Deleting files with extension '%s' in directory '%s'...\\\", ext_type, dir_path)\\n\\n    dir_path = Path(dir_path)\\n    if not dir_path.exists():\\n        logger.error(\\\"The directory '%s' does not exist.\\\", dir_path)\\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\\\"The directory '{dir_path}' does not exist.\\\")\\n    if not dir_path.is_dir():\\n        logger.error(\\\"'%s' is not a directory.\\\", dir_path)\\n        raise NotADirectoryError(f\\\"'{dir_path}' is not a directory.\\\")\\n\\n    # Sanitize the extension to prevent directory traversal\\n    if not ext_type.isalnum():\\n        logger.error(\\\"Invalid extension '%s'; contains non-alphanumeric characters.\\\", ext_type)\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Invalid extension '{ext_type}'\\\")\\n\\n    deleted = 0\\n    for file_path in dir_path.glob(f'*.{ext_type}'):\\n        try:\\n            if file_path.is_file():\\n                file_path.unlink()\\n                deleted += 1\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            logger.error(\\\"Failed to delete file '%s': %s\\\", file_path, e)\\n\\n    logger.info(\\\"Deleted %d files successfully.\\\", deleted)\\n    if deleted == 0:\\n        logger.warning(\\\"No files found with extension '%s'.\\\", ext_type)\\n\\nBut wait, the original code didn't check if dir_path is a directory. So the existing code checks exists() but not is_dir(). That could be a problem. If a file path is given, the code would proceed. So adding that check is good.\\n\\nBut in the original code, it constructs the command line as \\\"rm dir_path/*.ext\\\". But if dir_path is a file, then that command would expand to a non-existen glob, and exit with error. Perhaps, but the original code doesn't check. The revised code checks for is_dir().\\n\\nAlso, to make sure ext_type is safe, but are the alphanumeric sufficient? Maybe the extension can have other characters. For instance, a file extension like \\\".tar.gz\\\" is valid, which contains a dot. So my previous check for isalnum() would reject it. So, the regex should allow dots. Oops, in that case, the example's ext_type is like \\\"tar.gz\\\", so the pattern would be *.tar.gz. But Path's glob would handle that correctly.\\n\\nBut how to properly validate the extension. The extension should not contain path separators. So, check if the ext_type contains any / or \\\\. Also, perhaps * or other wildcards. For example, if the ext_type is '*', the pattern becomes .*.*, which would match all extensions. But maybe that's intended. Or if ext_type is \\\"pdf; rm -rf /\\\", but in Python code, the glob won't execute anything, but would it match files ending with \\\"; rm -rf /\\\". Which is possible, but that's not the injection problem since we're not using system commands anymore. The problem now would be if the function deletes unintended files, but the function's purpose is to delete all files with that exact extension. \\n\\nBut in the original code, the user passes the extension, perhaps taking from user input. The new code allows them to delete all files ending with that extension. The important thing is that now there's no shell involved, so command injection is eliminated. Even if ext_type is something malicious, it can only cause the deletion of files matching that pattern, but it's not executing arbitrary commands.\\n\\nTherefore, the main Bandit issue is resolved. For the ext_type's safety, perhaps the function should restrict the extension to certain patterns to prevent unintended deletions, but that's separate from the vulnerability described, which is shell injection.\\n\\nSo the revised code uses Pathlib to iterate over each file and delete it, thereby eliminating the use of os.system and shell execution. That addresses the B605 issue.\\n\\nThus, the final code would replace the command execution with a loop over the matched files and delete each one via path.unlink.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nOriginal code lines to replace:\\n\\ncommand = f\\\"rm {os.path.join(dir_path, f'*.{ext_type}')}\\\"\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\n\\nReplace with Python-based file deletion.\\n\\nIn code:\\n\\nAfter checking dir_path is a directory:\\n\\nfor filepath in Path(dir_path).glob(f'*.{ext_type}'):\\n    if filepath.is_file():\\n        filepath.unlink()\\n\\nBut need to handle exceptions. The original code only logs an error if os.system returns non-zero exit code. The revised code can catch exceptions per file.\\n\\nBut for strictness, the rewritten code might loop through each file and delete them individually, and log each success or failure.\\n\\nBut perhaps the original code doesn't care about individual files; just if all were deleted or not.\\n\\nBut the original code used \\\"rm\\\", which will delete all matching files, but there could be issues with permissions, etc. The exit_code is 0 if all are deleted, but non-zero if any failed.\\n\\nIn the new approach, the function would attempt to delete each file and track errors. But maybe the code should not raise an error if any single file fails, just report the error. But the original code checks if exit_code is 0; success message or error message.\\n\\nBut if the new code deletes some files and fails on others, what to report? The log messages can indicate the number of successful deletions. The original code logs \\\"Files deleted successfully\\\" only if the exit code was 0, which in shell means rm returned 0 if all files were successfully deleted. But rm returns 0 even if some files were not present, perhaps. For example, if no files matched, does rm return 0? Let's check: For \\\"rm *.foo\\\" where no files exist, the shell will expand the *.foo to a literal *.foo if there are no matches, and rm will say \\\"No such file or directory\\\" and exit with code 1. So the original code would have exit_code 1 if no files are found, and the error message. But perhaps that's a problem. So in the original code, that's a potential bug. The function claims to delete files, but if none are present, it logs an error.\\n\\nIn the revised code, the need is to replicate the behavior. So if no files are found, log that correctly.\\n\\nSo, in the revised code:\\n\\nCount how many files were deleted. If no files found, log a warning or error. If any files failed to delete, log each error.\\n\\nBut perhaps the original code did include the case where no files are present. However, in the new code:\\n\\n- Check if dir exists, etc.\\n- List all files matching the extension.\\n- Delete each one.\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n- If any exception occurred during the deletion (permission denied, etc.), log each.\\n- If no files are found, log \\\"no files found\\\".\\n\\nSo in the revised code:\\n\\ndir_path = Path(dir_path)\\n\\n...\\n\\next_type = ext_type.strip().lstrip('.')  # in case someone adds leading dot?\\n# or not—since the code is using f'*.{ext_type}'\\n\\n# Get list of files\\nfiles_to_delete = list(dir_path.glob(f'*.{ext_type}'))\\nsuccess_count = 0\\n\\nfor file_path in files_to_delete:\\n    try:\\n        if file_path.is_file():\\n            file_path.unlink()\\n            success_count +=1\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to delete file '%s': %s\\\", file_path, e)\\n\\nif success_count == len(files_to_delete) and len(files_to_delete) \\u003e0:\\n    logger.info(\\\"Files deleted successfully.\\\")\\nelif len(files_to_delete) \\u003e0:\\n    logger.error(\\\"Failed to delete some files.\\\")\\nelse:\\n    logger.error(\\\"No files found with extension '%s'.\\\", ext_type)\\n\\nBut this may differ from the original code's behavior. Alternatively, the original code's behavior on non-existing files is important to consider.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the original code's logic: if the rm command exits with 0, it's considered a success. But we can check if there's no matching files and decide the appropriate log. But that's more complex.\\n\\nBut given that the function is supposed to delete all files with the extension, the revised code's logging will be more accurate by counting the files. Perhaps in the revised code:\\n\\nif success_count \\u003e 0:\\n    logger.info(f\\\"{success_count} files deleted successfully.\\\")\\nif len(files_to_delete) \\u003e success_count:\\n    logger.error(f\\\"Failed to delete {len(files_to_delete) - success_count} files.\\\")\\n# maybe other cases.\\n\\nBut maybe to keep the original's behavior, when it logs an error only if exit code is non-zero. Exit code 0 could be even if some but not all files were deleted, if for example, some files were not deletable. But with the original code's approach using os.system, there's no way to know—exit code 0 indicates that the rm command succeeded, which may not be the case for multiple files.\\n\\nBut using os.system with \\\"rm\\\" would actually run rm, and if any file can't be deleted (e.g., permission denied), rm returns non-zero. Thus, the original code's exit_code ==0 indicates that rm ran successfully for all files. So, tha's not the same as using Python's individual deletes.\\n\\nSo the revised code needs to handle errors in a way that mimics the original but without the shell.\\n\\nBut given that this function is supposed to delete all files, and the most secure way is to use python-based deletions, the key is to replace the shell command.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code is to loop through each matched file and delete them using Python's unlink, with proper Error handling.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":438,\"completion_tokens\":3643,\"total_tokens\":4081},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

Let's see. The main issue is B605, which is about starting a process with a shell, leading to possible command injection. \\n\\nLooking at the original code: they use os.popen(cmd).read(). The problem here is that if 'cmd' includes any shell features like pipes or redirects, it could execute arbitrary commands. Since the function is supposed to enforce allowed subcommands, using a shell might bypass that validation.\\n\\nFirst, the code splits the command into parts using shlex.split(cmd), which parses the command into a list safely. They check if the primary command is in the approved list. But the execution part uses the original 'cmd' string, which is dangerous because even if the primary command is allowed, subsequent parts might not be properly validated. For example, if the user passes \\\"ls; rm -rf /\\\", the split might take 'ls;' as the primary command, but maybe that's not allowed. Wait, no—the shlex.split would split the command properly. Let me think: shlex.split handles splitting shell-like syntax into a list of arguments. So if the input is something like \\\"echo hello; rm -rf /\\\", shlex.split would split into ['echo', 'hello;', 'rm', '-rf', '/'], which might cause the primary_cmd to be 'echo' (if approved), but then allow the other parts. Wait, but in the original code, they check only the primary command, and let the subcommands pass? The problem here is that the code wasn't validating the subcommands, but the main vulnerability is using os.popen with the original cmd string. Because when you use os.popen with a string, it's executed in the shell, which can lead to injection if any part of the cmd isn't properly sanitized.\\n\\nSo even if they split the cmd into parts and check the primary command, they're still passing the original cmd string to os.popen, which is unsafe. Because someone could inject commands through the arguments. For example, if the approved_cmd_list includes 'echo', and someone passes 'echo hello \\u0026\\u0026 rm -rf /', the split would give ['echo', 'hello', '\\u0026\\u0026', 'rm', '-rf', '/']. The primary command is 'echo', which is allowed, but when executed in the shell, the '\\u0026\\u0026' will run the rm command. That's a problem.\\n\\nSo the root issue is using os.popen with the cmd string, which allows shell injection. To fix this, we should avoid using the shell. Instead, use subprocess.run with a list of command arguments and shell=False, which prevents the shell from interpreting any metacharacters.\\n\\nLet me modify the code accordingly. So instead of executing the original 'cmd' string, which goes through the shell, we should build the command as a list and execute it without the shell. However, the code might have intended to allow some subcommands that are part of the allowed list.\\n\\nWait, the current check only checks if the primary command (the first part after splitting) is in the approved list. The 'subcmds' variable is created but not checked. The comment says subcommands are not properly validated. So even if the primary command is allowed, like 'ls', the subcommands might have dangerous options or parameters. For example, 'ls; rm -rf /' would get split into ['ls;', 'rm', ...], but if 'ls;' isn't in approved, it's rejected. Hmm, maybe the splitting handles that. Let me check how shlex.split works. If the input is 'ls; echo hi', shlex.split would split into ['ls;', 'echo', 'hi']—so the primary command would be 'ls;', which is not in the approved list, leading to a ValueError. So that case would be blocked.\\n\\nBut let's take a case where the input is something like 'ls -la \\u0026\\u0026 rm -rf /'. shlex.split would split that into ['ls', '-la', '\\u0026\\u0026', 'rm', '-rf', '/']. The primary_cmd is 'ls', which is allowed (if in the approved list). Subcmds would be ['-la', '\\u0026\\u0026', 'rm', '-rf', '/'], which would be passed as arguments. However, when using os.popen(cmd).read(), the entire string is run in the shell, which would execute 'ls -la \\u0026\\u0026 rm -rf /', thus running both commands. Because the original code checks the primary command but not the subcommands, but using the shell to execute the entire command could allow injection through other means (like \\u0026\\u0026, ||, etc.) even if the primary command is allowed.\\n\\nSo the actual problem here is that even if the primary command is allowed, the way the command is executed (using os.popen with a string) allows shell metacharacters to execute additional commands. So the solution should be to avoid using a shell and execute the command as a list, which doesn't interpret metacharacters.\\n\\nSo how to fix this:\\n\\n1. Split the command into parts using shlex.split to handle quoting etc. correctly. But make sure that the entire command is built from the parts.\\n\\n2. Instead of checking just the primary command, perhaps check that all parts (if necessary) are allowed, but according to the problem's required function: the code is supposed to enforce constraints on which commands are allowed, checking user inputs against predefined valid subcommands. So maybe any subcommands after the primary need to be checked against a list. But the original code only checks 'primary_cmd', not the subcmds. Wait, the user input might be allowing insecure subcommands. But maybe the intended functionality is that only the primary command is approved, and the subcommands (arguments) can be anything, but according to Bandit's report, the problem is using the shell execution.\\n\\nBut regardless, the major vulnerability detected by Bandit is the use of a shell. So even if the command is 'ls -la; rm -rf /', the shlex.split would split into a list where primary_cmd is 'ls', and then the rest are arguments. However, if we use subprocess.run with the split parts (as a list) and shell=False, then the arguments are passed as parameters to 'ls', which is not a shell, so '; rm -rf /' would be considered a filename. Then it wouldn't execute the rm command. So that's the safe way.\\n\\nTherefore, to fix the B605 issue, we need to:\\n\\n- Avoid using os.popen, which runs the command in a shell.\\n\\n- Instead, use subprocess.run with the command parts as a list, setting shell=False.\\n\\nBut the code currently uses cmd as the input string, splits it into parts, verifies that the first part is in the approved list, then explicitly runs the original command string as a shell command.\\n\\nThis is bad because even if you split the command, if you run the original string via os.popen, you’re still allowing arbitrary shell features. The split checks might catch cases where someone uses a semicolon in the primary command, but if they manage to pass an allowed primary command followed by shell syntax, the split would get the allowed primary command but the execution would run the entire command string, leading to injection.\\n\\nSo to fix, the solution is to construct the command from the split parts and not use the original string. Then execute it via subprocess without a shell.\\n\\nSo, changing the execution part. Instead of:\\n\\nresult = os.popen(cmd).read()\\n\\nwhich is vulnerable, use:\\n\\nfrom the split parts (cmd_parts), which is [primary_cmd] + subcmds. Wait, earlier code does:\\n\\nprimary_cmd = cmd_parts[0]\\nsubcmds = cmd_parts[1:]\\n\\nBut the code's check is only if primary_cmd is in approved_cmd_list. Then runs the original 'cmd' string as a shell command, allowing possible shell injection.\\n\\nSo the split into parts helps in validating the primary command but execution uses the original unsplit string, which is the cause of the issue.\\n\\nSo, to execute safely, we should build the command from the split parts (cmd_parts) instead of using the original 'cmd' string. Then, since the parts are safe (after splitting and validation), execute as a list.\\n\\nTherefore, after checking that primary_cmd is allowed, execute the cmd_parts as a list. For example:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run(\\n    cmd_parts,\\n    capture_output=True,\\n    text=True,\\n    shell=False,\\n    check=True\\n)\\n\\nWait, but in the code, since cmd_parts is shlex.split(cmd), then using that list in subprocess.run is safe. Because shlex.split correctly splits the command into individual arguments, avoiding shell parsing. So substituting the code to run cmd_parts (the split list) instead of the original string would prevent shell injection.\\n\\nSo modifying the code to:\\n\\nAfter validation, execute using the split parts.\\n\\nBut need to import subprocess and handle the execution.\\n\\nSo in the original code, function is supposed to return the output or an error message. So perhaps using subprocess and check for errors.\\n\\nBut the original code uses os.popen, which in case of an error (non-zero exit code) may return the output, or if the command doesn't exist, raises an exception.\\n\\nWait, os.popen reads the command's stdout, but doesn't check for errors. So the original code would capture stdout but not stderr. But using subprocess would require capturing both.\\n\\nBut perhaps to mimic the original functionality, capture stdout and stderr and combine them. \\n\\nSo replacing os.popen(cmd).read() with subprocess.run with capture_output=True, then get the combined output.\\n\\nAlso, in the original code, the function returns the output or an error message. So in cases where the command execution fails (raises an exception), like if the command is not found, the current code returns the error message. The code uses a try-except block catching any exception. However, when using subprocess.run, if the 'check' parameter is True, it raises CalledProcessError on non-zero exit code. But in the code, perhaps it's better to capture all outputs, even if the command fails, so we can return them.\\n\\nThe original code would also return \\\"Disallowed command...\\\" if any exception is raised, but perhaps we need to differentiate between validation errors and execution errors.\\n\\nBut perhaps the code should raise ValueError only for invalid commands, and handle execution errors by returning their outputs (stderr maybe).\\n\\nLet's restructure.\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\ntry:\\n    split cmd into parts\\n    check primary_cmd in approved list\\n    execute cmd as string via os.popen, read output\\nexcept Exception:\\n    return error message.\\n\\nBut that's problematic because any error in the processing would result in the generic error message. For example, if the command is allowed but during execution an error occurs (e.g. command not found), it would return \\\"Disallowed command...\\\" which is incorrect. That's another issue with the original code.\\n\\nSo the fixes need to be:\\n\\n1. Split the command into parts using shlex.split.\\n\\n2. Check primary command is allowed.\\n\\n3. Execute the split parts as a subprocess, not using the shell.\\n\\n4. Properly handle exceptions, returning the execution error outputs rather than a generic message.\\n\\nLet me proceed step by step.\\n\\nFirst, modifying the execution part. Instead of os.popen(cmd), which runs the command as a string in the shell, use subprocess.run with the split cmd_parts. We should also capture both stdout and stderr.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\n\\n...\\n\\nproc = subprocess.run(\\n    cmd_parts,\\n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\\n    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,\\n    text=True,\\n    shell=False\\n)\\nif proc.returncode != 0:\\n    # handle error, maybe return stderr?\\n    return proc.stderr\\nelse:\\n    return proc.stdout\\n\\nBut the original code catches any exception. However, when using subprocess.run with shell=False, if the command is not found, subprocess.run will raise FileNotFoundError. So we need to handle that in the try block.\\n\\nBut in the original code, even if the command is allowed but invalid (like a non-existing binary), the code would raise an exception and return the generic error message, which is incorrect. For example, if someone calls the function with cmd=\\\"invalid_command\\\", which is in the approved_cmd_list, but does not exist, then os.popen would run it, return a non-None object, and the read would get an empty string (or error message?). So the original code's error handling is incorrect.\\n\\nSo to fix:\\n\\nIn the try block:\\n\\n- split the command into parts.\\n\\n- check primary command.\\n\\n- execute using subprocess.run.\\n\\nSo the new code:\\n\\ncmd_parts = shlex.split(cmd)\\nprimary_cmd = cmd_parts[0]\\n\\nif primary_cmd not in approved_cmd_list:\\n    raise ValueError(\\\"...\\\")\\n\\n# execute\\nproc = subprocess.run(\\n    cmd_parts,\\n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\\n    stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, # combine stderr and stdout\\n    text=True,\\n    shell=False\\n)\\nresult = proc.stdout\\nif proc.returncode != 0:\\n    # return the output, which may contain error messages\\n    # but according to the original code, it returns the output or error message\\n    # So perhaps return result, regardless of exit code.\\nreturn result\\n\\nBut how to handle command not found? If cmd_parts[0] is 'nonexistent', and in approved list, then subprocess.run will raise FileNotFoundError. That would go into the except block, and return \\\"Disallowed...\\\", which is wrong. So need to catch that.\\n\\nHowever, in the original code, the function is supposed to validate the command, but once validated, if the command is invalid (like does not exist), then the execution error should not result in \\\"Disallowed command\\\", but an error message from the command.\\n\\nTherefore, the try-except block should only wrap the processing, not the execution? Or differentiate between validation errors and execution errors.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should process the split command, validate, then execute using subprocess, and handle any errors, returning the captured output (both stdout and stderr).\\n\\nLet me re-structure the code:\\n\\nInside the try block:\\n\\ncmd_parts = shlex.split(cmd)\\nprimary_cmd = cmd_parts[0]\\n\\nif primary_cmd not in approved_cmd_list:\\n    raise ValueError(\\\"Disallowed command or subcommand.\\\")\\n\\n# Now, execute the cmd_parts without shell\\nproc = subprocess.run(\\n    cmd_parts,\\n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\\n    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,\\n    text=True,\\n    shell=False,\\n)\\n\\n# Combine stdout and stderr? Or what?\\nresult = proc.stdout + proc.stderr\\n\\nif proc.returncode !=0:\\n    # return the error?\\n    return result\\nelse:\\n    return result\\n\\nBut how to handle when the command can't be executed, like FileNotFound. So using a try-except around the subprocess.run.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\ntry:\\n    proc = subprocess.run(\\n        cmd_parts,\\n        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\\n        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,\\n        text=True,\\n        shell=False,\\n        check=True  # to raise exception on non-zero return code\\n    )\\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\\n    result = e.stdout + e.stderr\\nexcept FileNotFoundError as e:\\n    result = str(e)\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n    result = str(e)\\n\\nBut that's getting complicated. Alternatively, run without check=True and handle non-zero return codes by returning the output.\\n\\nBut the original code returns the output of the command regardless of exit code (using os.popen, which runs the command and returns output). So the original code doesn't care if the command exited with an error code, as long as it can produce stdout.\\n\\nTherefore, to replicate that, we can run the command without check=True, capture all output, and return.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nproc = subprocess.run(\\n    cmd_parts,\\n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\\n    stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,  # Combine stderr into stdout\\n    text=True,\\n    shell=False,\\n)\\nresult = proc.stdout\\n\\nreturn result\\n\\nThis way, stderr is captured into stdout, similar to how shell pipelines often redirect stderr to stdout.\\n\\nAdditionally, handling exceptions that occur during subprocess.run, like FileNotFoundError:\\n\\nBut if primary_cmd is in the approved list, but it's not a valid command (like 'invalidcommand'), the subprocess.run will raise FileNotFoundError when shell=False. So that's an exception that should be caught, and return an appropriate error message.\\n\\nIn this code, the problem is that in the original code's except block, all exceptions are caught and return \\\"Disallowed command...\\\", which is incorrect. For example, if the user provides a valid primary_cmd that's allowed but invalid (command not found), the code returns \\\"Disallowed...\\\", but the error has nothing to do with being allowed. So the current code converts all errors into \\\"Disallowed command...\\\" which is incorrect.\\n\\nTherefore, the try block should:\\n\\n- Split the command.\\n\\n- Validate primary_cmd.\\n\\nThen attempt to run the command. If during execution an error occurs (like command not found), it should return that error.\\n\\nBut the current code's error handling is:\\n\\nAny exception, return \\\"Disallowed...\\\". That's bad.\\n\\nSo need to restructure the try-except blocks.\\n\\nSo maybe split the code into different parts with separate error handling.\\n\\nProposals:\\n\\nInside the function:\\n\\ndef filtered_system_command(cmd: str, approved_cmd_list: list[str]) -\\u003e str:\\n    try:\\n        cmd_parts = shlex.split(cmd)\\n        if not cmd_parts:\\n            raise ValueError(\\\"Empty command.\\\")\\n        primary_cmd = cmd_parts[0]\\n        if primary_cmd not in approved_cmd_list:\\n            raise ValueError(\\\"Disallowed command or subcommand.\\\")\\n\\n        proc = subprocess.run(\\n            cmd_parts,\\n            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\\n            stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,  # Combine stderr into stdout\\n            text=True,\\n            shell=False,\\n        )\\n        return proc.stdout\\n\\n    except ValueError as ve:\\n        # Raised by our own checks\\n        return str(ve)\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        # Handle other exceptions like FileNotFoundError\\n        return f\\\"Error executing command: {str(e)}\\\"\\n\\nBut the original code's docstring says it raises ValueError, but in the code, returns error messages. Also, the return type is str, either the output or an error message.\\n\\nBut according to the problem statement, the function needs to check the inputs and return the output or an error message. So the ValueError is part of the input validation. The function may capture that ValueError and return the message, which aligns with the existing code.\\n\\nBut modifying the code to:\\n\\nIncluding handling of the ValueError (allowed commands) and other exceptions (command execution issues).\\n\\nBut step back: The original code had:\\n\\ntry:\\n   split cmd parts\\n   check primary\\n   execute via os.popen(cmd)\\n   return result\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n   return \\\"Disallowed command or subcommand.\\\"\\n\\nWhich is incorrect, since any exception during execution (like the command is allowed but not found) is converted to \\\"Disallowed...\\\" message.\\n\\nSo need to differentiate between\"},\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":511,\"completion_tokens\":4096,\"total_tokens\":4607},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The user provided a code snippet that's vulnerable due to the use of exec, which can execute arbitrary code and is a security risk. The task is to fix this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand why using exec is a problem. Exec runs any code passed to it, which could include malicious code. The function run_code_snippet takes a string and executes it directly, which is unsafe because there's no restriction on what the snippet can do.\\n\\nThe goal is to enforce strict safety rules. So, I need to find a way to run the code safely. One approach is to use a restricted environment or sandbox. However, Python's built-in sandboxing isn't foolproof. But maybe using the exec function with limited globals and locals would help.\\n\\nI should remove access to built-in functions and modules. By creating a custom environment where __builtins__ is None or an empty dict, the executed code can't access dangerous functions. Also, restrict the variables and functions that the snippet can use.\\n\\nAnother consideration is to parse the code for certain unsafe operations before execution. But static analysis might be complex. Using AST modules could detect unsafe nodes like imports or function definitions, but that's more involved.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the ast module to parse the code and check for allowed nodes. If the snippet contains forbidden nodes (like Import, ImportFrom, FunctionDef, etc.), reject it. Then, compile the AST into code and execute it in a restricted environment.\\n\\nCombining both approaches: parse the code with AST to disallow dangerous constructs, then execute in a restricted namespace. This way, even if some code gets through, it can't access harmful functions.\\n\\nSo, step by step:\\n\\n1. Parse the snippet into an abstract syntax tree.\\n2. Check each node in the tree for disallowed types (like imports, function definitions, class definitions, etc.).\\n3. If any disallowed nodes are found, raise an exception.\\n4. If the code passes the checks, execute it in a namespace without __builtins__ and with limited access.\\n\\nLet me draft code for that. Using ast.parse to parse the code, then iterating through all nodes. Forbid certain node types. Also, during execution, use a dictionary for globals that excludes __builtins__.\\n\\nWait, but even if I remove __builtins__, some built-in functions might still be accessible. Or perhaps not if the environment is correctly set.\\n\\nAlternatively, create a new empty globals dict and only allow certain safe built-ins, maybe. Though this might depend on the use case. The problem states \\\"enforce strict rules to ensure safety,\\\" so probably safest to remove all built-ins unless explicitly allowed.\\n\\nImplement the checks: define a list of allowed node types. Any node that's not in the allowed list would raise an error. For example, expressions, assignments, etc. But function definitions, imports, loops, etc., could be disallowed.\\n\\nOr, define a list of disallowed nodes and check if any such nodes exist in the AST.\\n\\nWhich is better? Maybe better to check for any forbidden nodes.\\n\\nFor example, classes like ast.Import, ast.ImportFrom, ast.FunctionDef, ast.ClassDef, etc.\\n\\nSo, creating a visitor that traverses the AST and checks for any forbidden nodes.\\n\\nHere's an outline:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\nclass SecurityVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.unsafe = False\\n\\n    def check_node(self, node):\\n        forbidden_nodes = (\\n            ast.Import, ast.ImportFrom,\\n            ast.FunctionDef, ast.ClassDef,\\n            ast.Lambda, ast.Call,\\n            ast.Attribute,\\n            # Maybe other nodes like accessing certain attributes\\n        )\\n        if isinstance(node, forbidden_nodes):\\n            self.unsafe = True\\n        self.generic_visit(node)\\n\\ndef run_code_snippet(snippet: str):\\n    try:\\n        tree = ast.parse(snippet)\\n    except SyntaxError:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid syntax\\\")\\n\\n    visitor = SecurityVisitor()\\n    visitor.visit(tree)\\n\\n    if visitor.unsafe:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Unsafe code detected\\\")\\n\\n    restricted_globals = {'__builtins__': {}}\\n    exec(snippet, restricted_globals)\\n    return None\\n\\nWait, but even if we disallow certain nodes, there might be other ways to execute code. Additionally, the check for Call nodes would prevent any function calls, which might be too restrictive, but according to the problem statement, the rules should be strict. However, allowing function calls would introduce risks if they can access built-ins.\\n\\nBut maybe the problem allows certain function calls. This is tricky. The original problem says to enforce strict rules for safety. So perhaps allowing only a subset of safe operations.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe using the RestrictedPython module which limits certain operations. But the user might expect a solution without external dependencies.\\n\\nAssuming that external modules aren't allowed, then a custom solution with AST checking is needed.\\n\\nFor example, allowing only expressions and simple calculations, but not allowing function calls, imports, etc.\\n\\nIn the SecurityVisitor, the forbidden nodes should include anything unsafe. However, even expressions can do things like (lambda: ...)(), which might execute arbitrary code if builtins are available.\\n\\nBut if we block function definitions (lambda, FunctionDef), and also prevent calls, but perhaps allowing literals and simple operations.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps a whitelist approach: only allow certain node types. For example, expressions that involve literals, arithmetic operations, etc., but nothing else.\\n\\nBut this depends on what the code snippet is intended to do. The original code didn't specify restrictions, just needed to be secure.\\n\\nAnother thought: replace __builtins__ with a limited set of safe functions. For example, exclude all except for certain ones like int, str, etc. But even those can have issues (e.g., opening files or accessing modules if allowed).\\n\\nBut if __builtins__ is an empty dict, then even access to open, __import__, etc., would be blocked.\\n\\nSo, perhaps:\\n\\nrestricted_globals = {'__builtins__': None}\\n\\nOr, {}.\\n\\nWait, when __builtins__ is included in the globals, some built-in functions may still be accessible. But if the exec function is provided with a globals dict that has __builtins__ set to None or an empty dict, then the executed code can't access them.\\n\\nIn Python, by default, when you exec code, it has access to the __builtins__ module. So if you pass a globals dictionary without it, or with __builtins__ set to an empty dict or None, that restricts access.\\n\\nSo, in the fixed code, during the exec call, set the globals to a new empty dict with __builtins__ set to nothing.\\n\\nMoreover, parsing the AST for forbidden nodes (imports, function definitions, class definitions, etc.) will prevent some code structures. For example, blocking the use of import statements even if the code tried to use them, but without the parsed check, the exec would just raise an error. The check adds an additional layer of security.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would first parse the code into an AST, check for disallowed nodes, then execute the code in an environment with no access to built-ins.\\n\\nLet me draft this:\\n\\nFirst, implement the AST parsing and node checking.\\n\\nThen, during execution, use a restricted environment.\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\nclass SecurityVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.unsafe = False\\n\\n    def visit_Import(self, node):\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n\\n    def visit_ImportFrom(self, node):\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n\\n    def visit_FunctionDef(self, node):\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n\\n    def visit_ClassDef(self, node):\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n\\n    def visit_Lambda(self, node):\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n\\n    def visit_Call(self, node):\\n        # Calls can be dangerous, but some are allowed?\\n        # Maybe block all calls as unsafe.\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n\\ndef run_code_snippet(snippet: str):\\n    # Parse the code snippet into AST\\n    try:\\n        tree = ast.parse(snippet, mode='exec')\\n    except SyntaxError as e:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Syntax error in code: {e}\\\")\\n\\n    # Check for unsafe nodes\\n    visitor = SecurityVisitor()\\n    visitor.visit(tree)\\n\\n    if visitor.unsafe:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Code snippet contains unsafe constructs\\\")\\n\\n    # Execute in a restricted environment\\n    restricted_globals = {'__builtins__': {}}\\n    exec(snippet, restricted_globals)\\n    return None\\n\\nBut this draft code checks for imports, function/class definitions, lambdas, and any function calls. But calls are very common, like print(1+1) which is a call. However, in the restricted environment, __builtins__ are empty, so even print isn't available. But the 'call' nodes could also be math operations. Wait, no. For example, (1).__class__ would be allowed, which could access unsafe classes.\\n\\nBut with __builtins__ disabled, even access to such methods is possible? For example, even in a restricted environment, can you call something like [].__class__.__base__?\\n\\nThat's a problem. So the AST check is also not enough to block all possible unsafe operations. Hence, maybe the security of this code is not perfect, but it's an improvement over the original.\\n\\nBut according to the Bandit analysis, the main issue is using exec. The user wants to fix it by enforcing strict rules. The solution above adds both static checks (parsing AST to block certain nodes) and a restricted environment.\\n\\nHowever, depending on how strict the rules are supposed to be, even with this, there could be possible vulnerabilities. For example, the code could do something like (1).__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() which gives access to certain classes, possibly leading to shell access. This is a known Python sandbox escape.\\n\\nBut given that building a completely secure sandbox in Python is very hard, the best we can do here is to minimize the attack surface as per the problem's instructions.\\n\\nTherefore, the steps taken are:\\n\\n1. Check the code for import statements, function/class definitions, lambdas, etc., using AST.\\n\\n2. Execute the code in a restricted environment with __builtins__ disabled.\\n\\nIs the fix acceptable given Bandit's warning? Since Bandit flags exec as potentially dangerous, the way to address it is to avoid usage unless properly secured. Using the AST checks and the restricted environment might be considered sufficient for some cases, even though not 100% secure.\\n\\nAlso, the original code allowed any code execution; the fixed code now adds some restrictions, which is the requirement here.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code should include the AST parsing, check for dangerous nodes, and execute in a restricted environment.\\n\\nLet me check again the code:\\n\\n- The visitor checks for Import, ImportFrom, FunctionDef, ClassDef, Lambda, and Call nodes. But is Call too broad? If the user is allowed to use function calls, but in a safe environment, that's possible. But with __builtins__ disabled, most function calls would fail. However, allowing any Call might let the code, for example, call methods on objects, potentially accessing dangerous attributes. Hence, in the strictest case, blocking all calls. However, this might be too restrictive.\\n\\nBut according to the problem statement, the function should \\\"enforce strict rules to ensure safety.\\\" So it's better to block as much as possible. If the user needs to allow certain calls, then it's a problem. However, in the given scenario, we have to follow the rule.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the SecurityVisitor can just check for the presence of import, function, class definitions, and calls to certain functions.\\n\\nBut how? It's tricky. Maybe for simplicity, block any Call node. So in the visitor, override visit_Call, for example:\\n\\ndef visit_Call(self, node):\\n    # Check if the function being called is from a safe list\\n    # But without access to the actual code, this is hard.\\n    # Alternatively, block all function calls.\\n    self.unsafe = True\\n    self.generic_visit(node)\\n\\nIf we set this, then any function call (even something as simple as len([])) would be blocked. That's very restrictive. However, in the given scenario, maybe that's acceptable.\\n\\nBut it depends on the intended use of the run_code_snippet function. If it's supposed to allow simple expressions such as 2+2, but not function calls, then blocking Calls is acceptable.\\n\\nBut in the example code, if the code was allowed to run code snippets, needing to calculate expressions, then allowing basic operations but preventing invocations. However, function calls are a necessary part of many code snippets. However, given the requirement to secure it, maybe the function is intended to run only very limited snippets.\\n\\nBut perhaps the problem is more about the use of exec without restrictions, and we need to add as much restrictions as possible, even if it limits functionality.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the security scanner's report can be addressed by other means. For example, using a separate interpreter or process with limited permissions, but that's beyond code-level fixes.\\n\\nBack to the code, in the current solution, we can:\\n\\n- Only allow expressions (not statements). So changing the mode to 'eval' when parsing. But then the user would have to pass an expression, not a code snippet. So perhaps the original function is intended to run code snippets (multiple statements).\\n\\nWait, the original code used 'exec(snippet)', so it's expecting a snippet as a string that can be any code.\\n\\nTherefore, switching to 'eval' would restrict it, but the function's parameters would need to be amended.\\n\\nBut since the function is called 'run_code_snippet' and the parameter is a 'snippet', it suggests that the code may have statements.\\n\\nSo we have to allow the 'exec' mode.\\n\\nGiven that, the previous code may still be vulnerable. For instance, a code snippet like:\\n\\n__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')\\n\\nBut in the restricted environment, since __builtins__ is empty and __import__ is a built-in function, this wouldn't be accessible. But if the code snippet can somehow get a reference to a built-in function, that's dangerous.\\n\\nHowever, in the restricted_globals, __builtins__ is set to {}, so accessing __import__ would be prohibited. Unless there's another way to get it.\\n\\nBut for example, even in restricted_globals, in Python, some built-in functions may still be accessible. Test it:\\n\\nIf I run:\\n\\nrestricted_globals = {'__builtins__': None}\\nexec(\\\"print('hi')\\\", restricted_globals)\\n\\nThis would error because print is not available.\\n\\nSimilarly, trying to use __import__ would raise an error.\\n\\nMoreover, your SecurityVisitor checks for Attribute and others, which could access object attributes.\\n\\nWait, in the previous SecurityVisitor, we're checking for Call nodes. If the code snippet is '().__class__', then the AST would include an Attribute node (for accessing .__class__). Allowing this could lead to accessing sensitive attributes.\\n\\nSo, the SecurityVisitor needs to check for Attribute access as well.\\n\\nBut adding:\\n\\ndef visit_Attribute(self, node):\\n    self.unsafe = True\\n    self.generic_visit(node)\\n\\nBut this would block all attribute access, like simple things like [1, 2, 3].append(4), which may be allowable. However, allowing any attribute access can lead to vulnerabilities. So, in the interest of maximum safety, block all attribute access.\\n\\nBut then even i = 5; i.real would be impossible.\\n\\nTherefore, ensuring the code runs in an extremely limited environment.\\n\\nTherefore, the SecurityVisitor would check for the following Node types:\\n\\n- Import, ImportFrom\\n- FunctionDef, ClassDef, Lambda\\n- Call, Attribute\\n- Possibly others like Subscript, or others that may be vectors for attack.\\n\\nBut occasionally, it's possible to access some methods or attributes even without built-ins.\\n\\nBut building a completely safe solution within Python's limitations is quite challenging.\\n\\nHowever, per the problem's requirements, the solution needs to address the exec_used vulnerability reported by Bandit, which calls for securing the exec call.\\n\\nBy using a restricted environment (limiting globals and built-ins) and performing static checks for dangerous code constructs, this could be considered a sufficient mitigation for the reported issue.\\n\\nThus, the corrected code would include both steps.\\n\\nNow, let's test the code with an example:\\n\\nSample snippet: \\\"print('hello')\\\"\\n\\nParsing the code would generate an AST with a Call node (print is a function call). The visitor would set unsafe to True, thus raising ValueError.\\n\\nBut in this case, the code is safe if built-ins are disallowed. But with SecurityVisitor's check, it's detected as unsafe because there's a Call node.\\n\\nSo the code would be rejected, but in reality, even if allowed, the print statement would fail because __builtins__ is empty.\\n\\nThis approach is being extra cautious, blocking even inert code. But the problem states to enforce strict rules to ensure safety, perhaps deeming this acceptable.\\n\\nThus, the code blocks code snippets that contain:\\n\\n- Imports\\n- Function/Class definitions\\n- Lambdas\\n- Call nodes (any function/method call)\\n- Attribute accesses.\\n\\nThis is very restrictive but secure.\\n\\nHence, the final fixed code:\\n\\nImplementing AST checks and restricted globals.\\n\\nBut wait, the current SecurityVisitor in the code doesn't check for Call \\u0026 Attribute yet. In the previous draft code, the SecurityVisitor only checks for Import, ImportFrom, FunctionDef, ClassDef, Lambda, and Call. However, the code has:\\n\\ndef visit_Call(self, node):\\n    self.unsafe = True\\n    ...\\n\\nBut user code like 'x = 1 + 1' involves no Calls or other forbidden nodes. So that would be allowed, and get executed in the restricted environment.\\n\\nBut what about 'x = (1).__class__'? This code snippet has an Attribute node (accessing __class__). So the SecurityVisitor must check for Attribute nodes to block that.\\n\\nSo, revised SecurityVisitor should check Attribute nodes as well.\\n\\nTherefore, updating the SecurityVisitor class:\\n\\ndef visit_Attribute(self, node):\\n    self.unsafe = True\\n    self.generic_visit(node)\\n\\nSo now, any attribute access would be blocked.\\n\\nThus, any code that accesses attributes are considered unsafe.\\n\\nWith these modifications, the code snippet containing x = (1).__class__ would be blocked because of the Attribute node in the AST.\\n\\nThis is very restrictive but possibly required to prevent various sandbox escapes.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code will:\\n\\n- Parse the snippet's AST.\\n- Check for presence of any disallowed nodes (Imports, function/class definitions, calls, attributes, etc.).\\n- If detected, raise an error.\\n- Otherwise, execute in a restricted environment with no access to built-ins.\\n\\nSo the fixed code would look like this:\\n\\nimport ast\\n\\nclass SecurityVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.unsafe = False\\n    \\n    def visit_Import(self, node):\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n    \\n    def visit_ImportFrom(self, node):\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n    \\n    def visit_FunctionDef(self, node):\\n        self.unsafe = True\\n    \\n    def\"},\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":258,\"completion_tokens\":4096,\"total_tokens\":4354},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

Splitting that into a list of arguments: [\\\"tar\\\", \\\"-czvf\\\", f\\\"{backup_name}.tar.gz\\\", \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, \\\".\\\"].\\n\\nWait, the options here: the -C directory_path is followed by the directory \\\".\\\" to change to that directory, which is correct. Also, the backup_name should be properly escaped. Since we are using subprocess without shell=True, the arguments are passed directly to the command, so there's no risk of shell injection here.\\n\\nAdditionally, when using subprocess.run, we can check the return code. The exit code from tar will be available via returncode attribute. The check parameter can be set to False to allow non-zero exit codes to be handled manually.\\n\\nBut I need to replace os.system(command) with subprocess.run(args, ...). So putting it all together:\\n\\nReplace the line exit_code = os.system(command) with something like:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run([\\\"tar\\\", \\\"-czvf\\\", f\\\"{backup_name}.tar.gz\\\", \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, \\\".\\\"])\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nAlso, need to import subprocess if not already imported. The original code doesn't have an import for os? Wait, the original uses os.system, so they probably imported os. So adding import subprocess.\\n\\nWait, but the user's code may already have subprocess imported? Let me check the code again. The original code uses os.system, so they have 'import os', but probably not subprocess. So in the fixed code, I'll need to import subprocess. However, the user's original code is a function, so the import statement might need to be added.\\n\\nWait, in the code snippet provided, the user wrote:\\n\\ndef backup_directory(...):\\n    logger.info(...)\\n    command = ...\\n    exit_code = os.system(...)\\n    etc.\\n\\nTherefore, the code may have an import for os and a logger. So to use subprocess.run, they need to import subprocess at the top. But in the code snippet, perhaps the import isn't included. Since the user provided a function, the fix requires changing the command execution.\\n\\nSo the correct approach is to construct the command as a list of arguments, then use subprocess.run with shell=False (which is the default).\\n\\nLet me also check for potential issues with the backup_name and directory_path. Since we're passing them as arguments to tar, if they contain spaces or special characters, using the list form of subprocess.run handles them safely. But the parameters need to be properly passed. For example, backup_name might have spaces, but as it's passed as an argument, tar will create a file with that name including spaces. So that's okay.\\n\\nSo replacing the command line construction from a string to a list. Also, verifying that all parts are properly split. The original command was \\\"tar -czvf {backup_name}.tar.gz -C {directory_path} .\\\". Breaking this down:\\n\\n- The arguments are: \\\"-czvf\\\", the backup_name + .tar.gz, then \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, then \\\".\\\".\\n\\nSo the list should be: [\\\"tar\\\", \\\"-czvf\\\", f\\\"{backup_name}.tar.gz\\\", \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, \\\".\\\"]\\n\\nWait, no, in the original command, \\\"-C {directory_path}\\\" is followed by the directory to add (.), so the tar command syntax is correct. The parameters for -C is the directory path, then the next arguments are files to include. So in the list format, \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, then \\\".\\\" are the two parts. So that's correct.\\n\\nSo putting all that together.\\n\\nThe fixed code should use subprocess.run with that argument list, capturing the exit code. Also, handling any exceptions? Well, os.system would have returned the exit code. Using subprocess, perhaps we need to update the code to capture the exit code properly.\\n\\nOriginal code:\\n\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\nif exit_code == 0: ...\\n\\nWith subprocess:\\n\\nresult = subprocess.run([...])\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nThat's correct.\\n\\nSo replacing the command and os.system with subprocess.run. Also, since the function could raise an OSError on failure, that part remains the same.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code would be:\\n\\nImport subprocess. Wait, the code snippet given by the user doesn't show imports. So, in the fixed function, perhaps the user's code already includes necessary imports. The user should have \\\"import subprocess\\\" somewhere, or it needs to be added.\\n\\nBut from the user's provided code, the original code uses os.system, which requires import os, so maybe the code has that. The user expects the fixed code to be included. So, the fixed code's function would need to have import os and import subprocess in their code, but perhaps that's not part of the function. Therefore, the assistant should focus on adjusting the code lines within the function.\\n\\nTherefore, the code change would involve:\\n\\nChanging the command to a list, and running subprocess.run with that list.\\n\\nSo the corrected lines would look like:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"tar\\\", \\\"-czvf\\\", f\\\"{backup_name}.tar.gz\\\", \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, \\\".\\\"]).returncode\\n\\nAlternatively, breaking it down into a variable for better readability:\\n\\ncommand_args = [\\\"tar\\\", \\\"-czvf\\\", f\\\"{backup_name}.tar.gz\\\", \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, \\\".\\\"]\\nresult = subprocess.run(command_args, check=False)\\nexit_code = result.returncode\\n\\nBut even better, the check is not set to True, so it doesn't raise an exception, allowing the code to handle the exit code as before.\\n\\nTherefore, integrating all of that into the fixed code.\\n\\nSo the original code is:\\n\\nexit_code = os.system(command)\\n...\\n\\nWhich becomes (with subprocess):\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(\\n    [\\\"tar\\\", \\\"-czvf\\\", f\\\"{backup_name}.tar.gz\\\", \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, \\\".\\\"],\\n).returncode\\n\\nSo replacing the command construction from a string to a list.\\n\\nTherefore, the logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command) line would now output a list. Wait no—the logging line is printing the command as a string. To maintain consistency but use subprocess, perhaps the logging line should log the command being executed. But the way I'm constructing the command as a list now changes what is being logged. So the original logging line will output a formatted string like \\\"tar -czvf backup.tar.gz ...\\\", but with the new code, command is built as a list, which we need to log as a command string.\\n\\nWait, how did the original code have that command as a string. When using os.system, they pass the entire command as a string. But in the fixed code, using subprocess, the command is broken into a list of args.\\n\\nTherefore, the logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command) would have to be changed as well. The original code's 'command' variable was the string, but now in the fixed code, we are not using that.\\n\\nSo to fix the logging line as well.\\n\\nSo, let's reconstruct the original logging line. The original code logs the command as \\\"tar -czvf ...\\\". Using subprocess, since the command is a list, to get a string that represents the command correctly (with arguments properly separated), perhaps join the list with spaces. But that's not necessarily 100% accurate for logging (as arguments with spaces need to be quoted), but for logging purposes, joining with spaces would be similar to what was being done before.\\n\\nTherefore, in the fixed code, instead of building a command string, build a command_args list, and log the joined list.\\n\\nWait, perhaps:\\n\\ncommand_args = [\\n    \\\"tar\\\", \\\"-czvf\\\", f\\\"{backup_name}.tar.gz\\\",\\n    \\\"-C\\\", directory_path, \\\".\\\"\\n]\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", \\\" \\\".join(command_args))\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(command_args).returncode\\n\\nThis way, the logging shows the command as it's being executed. This is important because otherwise, the logger.info line would not have any command to show.\\n\\nSo, the complete corrected code would be:\\n\\ndef backup_directory(directory_path: str, backup_name: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Creates a compressed backup of the specified directory.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Creating backup...\\\")\\n    command_args = [\\n        \\\"tar\\\",\\n        \\\"-czvf\\\",\\n        f\\\"{backup_name}.tar.gz\\\",\\n        \\\"-C\\\",\\n        directory_path,\\n        \\\".\\\"\\n    ]\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", \\\" \\\".join(command_args))\\n    exit_code = subprocess.run(command_args).returncode\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Backup created successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to create backup; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n        raise OSError(\\\"Backup creation failed\\\")\\n\\nAdditionally, the function needs to import subprocess, but since the user's original code may not have it, but the problem statement only provides the function snippet, it's up to the user to include the necessary imports. However, the assistant should include the fixed function as per the question.\\n\\nThus, the fixed code uses subprocess.run with a list of arguments instead of a shell command, preventing shell injection, so Bandit's B605 is resolved.\"},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":378,\"completion_tokens\":2281,\"total_tokens\":2659},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"

The Bandit analysis pointed out issues with using the pickle module because deserializing untrusted data with pickle can be dangerous. So the problem is that when the method_type is 'pickle', it's using pickle.loads which can execute arbitrary code. That's a security risk if the input comes from an untrusted source.\\n\\nSo the task is to remove the unsafe deserialization methods. The function currently supports 'json', 'csv', and 'pickle'. The pickle part is the issue here. Since the function's goal is to prevent security risks, the best approach is to disallow the pickle method entirely.\\n\\nLooking at the original code, the elif clause for 'pickle' imports pickle and returns pickle.loads. To fix this, I should remove that entire block. But then the user might expect an error if they try to use 'pickle'. So instead of just removing it, maybe the function should raise an error when 'pickle' is selected. The original code already raises ValueError for unsupported methods, but since the user provided 'pickle' is now considered unsafe, the function shouldn't support it anymore.\\n\\nWait, the original code correctly raises an error for unsupported methods, but pickle was a supported option. So the fix is to remove the 'pickle' case from the allowed method_types. Therefore, the elif method_type == \\\"pickle\\\": block should be deleted. Now, if someone tries to use 'pickle' as the method_type, it will fall into the else clause and raise ValueError, indicating it's not supported. That way, the insecure method is no longer allowed.\\n\\nSo I'll edit the code by removing the pickle code. So the code for 'json' and 'csv' stays, and the 'pickle' code is removed. Let me check the original code again:\\n\\nThe original code has three cases: json, csv, and pickle. So by deleting the elif for pickle, any request to use pickle will hit the else and raise an error.\\n\\nYes. That makes the function safe, removing the insecure deserialization method. The user instructions require validating the serialization format and only allowing permitted methods. By excluding pickle, the validation ensures that only json and csv are allowed.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code will not have the pickle case anymore. That way, any attempt to use it will result in an error. Also, the import statements need to be adjusted. Oh and the Bandit's report highlights issues on lines 14 and 15 where pickle is imported and used. By removing those lines, the issues are resolved.\\n\\nSo the fixed code should look like:\\ndef parse_stream(stream_bytes, method_type=\\\"json\\\"):\\n    if method_type == \\\"json\\\":\\n        import json\\n        return json.loads(stream_bytes)\\n    elif method_type == \\\"csv\\\":\\n        import csv\\n        from io import StringIO\\n        reader = csv.reader(StringIO(stream_bytes.decode()))\\n        return [row for row in reader]\\n    else:\\n        raise ValueError(f\\\"Unsupported serialization method: {method_type}\\\")\\n\\nThat removes the 'pickle' case entirely. Now, any usage of 'pickle' as the method_type will trigger the ValueError. This prevents the use of insecure deserialization methods.

The user provided a code snippet that's vulnerable to shell injection because it uses os.system with a command constructed using string formatting. The Bandit analysis flagged this as a high severity issue (B605).\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand why using os.system with a shell command is bad here. The main issue is that if the file_path variable contains any malicious input, like something with semicolons or backticks, it could execute arbitrary commands. So, we need to avoid using the shell and instead use a subprocess method that doesn't invoke the shell.\\n\\nThe original code uses os.system(command), which runs the command through the shell. The fix would be to use subprocess.run without shell=True. But wait, pigar is a command-line tool, so we need to call it correctly. Let me check how pigar's command works. The original line is \\\"pigar gen -f {file_path} {current_dir}\\\". The arguments are the output file and the directory to scan.\\n\\nSo I should split the command into parts: [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", file_path, os.getcwd()]. That way, each argument is passed directly to the executable without involving the shell.\\n\\nAlso, replacing os.system with subprocess.run would be better. We can run subprocess.run() with the command list, check the return code, and capture the exit code. But I have to handle exceptions as well. The original code checks if the exit code is 0. Using subprocess.run with check=False (the default) and then checking the returncode attribute should work.\\n\\nFurthermore, importing subprocess since the original code didn't use it. So add an import for subprocess.\\n\\nNow, adjust the code accordingly. The line where the command is executed would be replaced with something like:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", file_path, os.getcwd()]).returncode\\n\\nBut wait, the arguments: file_path is a Path object here? Let me check: in the original code, it's Path(file_path) when constructing the command string. Wait, the original command was f\\\"pigar gen -f {Path(file_path)} {os.getcwd()}\\\".\\n\\nActually, when building the command list, we need to pass the file_path as a string. Because if file_path is a Path object, converting to string might be necessary, but the function's parameter is file_path: str, so perhaps it's already a string. So the arguments would be \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", file_path, os.getcwd(). So the command list would be [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", file_path, os.getcwd()].\\n\\nAnother point: when using subprocess.run, it's important to pass each argument as a separate element in the list. This prevents shell injection because there's no shell involved to interpret any metacharacters.\\n\\nSo replacing the os.system(command) line. Also, the imports: the code already has an 'import os' because it uses os.getcwd(). The code didn't import subprocess, so I'll need to add that.\\n\\nBut looking at the given code, the imports are only from pigar (inside the try-except) and os. So inserting 'import subprocess' before using subprocess.\\n\\nBut wait, in the original code, there's a 'logger' variable. Let me check if the code is part of a larger function, but in the provided code, the imports inside the function might be problematic. Wait, the import of pigar is inside a try-except within the function. But in general, imports are usually at the top, but that's another issue. However, in this context, perhaps the code should be kept as close to the original structure as possible, except for fixing the vulnerability.\\n\\nSo the corrected code steps:\\n\\n- Replace os.system(command) with subprocess.run([...]).returncode.\\n\\n- Use arguments as separate elements, no shell=True.\\n\\nNow, here's the detail: in the original command, it's \\\"pigar gen -f {file_path} {current_dir}\\\".\\n\\nBreaking this into a list:\\n\\n[\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(file_path), os.getcwd()]\\n\\nBut file_path is a string argument (as per the function parameter), so converting it to string with str() may not be necessary. However, perhaps using Path(file_path) might be better for handling paths properly, but then converting to a string. But the original code uses f\\\"pigar gen -f {Path(file_path)} {os.getcwd()}\\\" so perhaps Path is used to get the correct path string.\\n\\nWait, the original code uses 'file_path' as a string. So perhaps, in the command line, the Path(file_path) is converting the string to a Path object and then back to a string when formatting. Maybe that's redundant. But the correct way is to ensure that the path is properly formatted. However, for the fix, the key is to pass the file_path and current directory as separate arguments.\\n\\nThus, the subprocess line should be:\\n\\nsubprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", file_path, os.getcwd()], ...)\\n\\nWait, but in the original command, after '-f' comes the output file. So in the subprocess call, each argument should be in the list:\\n\\n[\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", file_path, os.getcwd()]\\n\\nYes, and since os.getcwd() returns a string, that's okay.\\n\\nSo replacing the command line with subprocess.run, catching exceptions? No, the original code checked the exit code. Using subprocess.run() will raise an exception by default only if check=True. However, in the original code, the exit code is being captured. So setting check=False (default), and then accessing .returncode.\\n\\nAlternatively, catching CalledProcessError if check=True. But the original code's logic is to check the exit code. Thus, in the corrected code, the line would be:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", file_path, os.getcwd()]).returncode\\n\\nThat way, exit_code is captured. So the code is adjusted:\\n\\nOriginal code has: command = ... os.system(command). Which returns the exit code. So with subprocess.run, the returncode attribute holds the exit code.\\n\\nThus, the corrected line is:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", file_path, os.getcwd()]).returncode\\n\\nAdditionally, adding an import for subprocess.\\n\\nBut looking at the code, there's no import for subprocess. So the fixed code needs to have 'import subprocess' at the top. However, in the given code, all the code is inside the function. Wait, no. The code starts with the function def, but inside the function there's a try-except importing pigar.\\n\\nBut in the original code, there's no 'import subprocess'. So that needs to be added somewhere. Since the original code had import os (because they're using os.getcwd() and os.system), but that's likely imported outside.\\n\\nWait, the code snippet starts with the function, and I'm supposed to provide the fixed code. But to include the necessary imports, if the original code didn't have subprocess imported, but in the code as given, maybe it's missing. However, the user's code may have the necessary imports.\\n\\nWait, looking at the code again. The user's code is:\\n\\ndef list_dependencies(file_path: str):\\n    ... some code ...\\n    command = f\\\"pigar gen -f {Path(file_path)} {os.getcwd()}\\\"\\n    exit_code = os.system(command)\\n\\nTherefore, the code must have already imported os (for os.getcwd() and os.system). Also, Path is from pathlib. So from pathlib import Path. But the user's code may have that elsewhere.\\n\\nBut in the corrected code, to use subprocess, you need to import it. Therefore, to include import subprocess in the fixed code. However, since in the function it's nested inside, the import should be at the top of the file. But the original code doesn't show the imports. Therefore, to make the code self-contained, adding import subprocess either inside the function (bad practice) or at the top. However, by convention, imports are at the top. So in the given code, the existing imports like os and Path, but the function's code has a try-except block for importing pigar.\\n\\nBut the code provided doesn't include the top-level imports. Wait, the code the user gave is:\\n\\nThe original code snippet includes the function but does not show import statements except for within the try-except. But given that Path and os.getcwd() are used, there must be imports like from pathlib import Path and import os in the original code. So in the fixed code, we need to add import subprocess.\\n\\nThus, the code may require adding:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\n\\nAt the top. However, in the code the user provided, perhaps the function is part of a larger script where os and subprocess are already imported. However, according to the problem, the fixed code should be standalone. So in the fixed code, the necessary imports need to be present.\\n\\nBut in the original code given, the function had no top-level imports, except the ones inside the try-except. Therefore, the correct approach would be to add necessary imports at the top.\\n\\nBut the original problem says \\\"provide the corrected version of the code\\\" as the answer. The original code doesn't show imports for os or pathlib.Path; but given that it uses os.getcwd() and Path(file_path), those must come from proper imports. So the corrected code should include:\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport subprocess\\nimport logging\\n...\\n\\nBut in the code, the logger is also used. For the code to work, we need all necessary imports. However, the user likely expects that the corrected code includes the necessary imports, even if they aren't in the original snippet. However, the original code provided may have some of those already in place, and maybe only the pigar import is within the try block.\\n\\nSince the user provided a code snippet, we must assume that the original code includes the necessary imports (like os, logging, etc.), except for subprocess which is needed for the fix.\\n\\nBut since the code as given would have to include those imports for it to work, and we're only replacing the shell command execution part.\\n\\nSo to keep the code as close as possible, add import subprocess at the top, unless the original code already has it. But given that os.system was used, the user's code may not import subprocess yet. However, in the function's code, they are now using subprocess.run(), so they need to import it.\\n\\nTherefore, in the fixed code, imports must be present for subprocess. That means adding a \\\"import subprocess\\\" line. However, the code snippet the user provided does not show the top-level imports, only the function. So the fixed function would need to have that import somewhere.\\n\\nWait, in Python, you can't import inside the function multiple times. Well, you can, but it's not efficient, but in the original code, pigar is imported inside the try-except. But that's part of the logic. However, importing subprocess inside the function would be possible but not best practice.\\n\\nBut according to standard practices, it's better to have imports at the top. Therefore, in the corrected code, adding 'import subprocess' at the top.\\n\\nSo considering all these aspects, the fixed code would:\\n\\n- Replace the os.system(command) with subprocess.run.\\n\\n- Split the command into a list of arguments.\\n\\n- Import subprocess.\\n\\nSo here is the fixed code step by step:\\n\\nFirst, add necessary import:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\n\\nBut in the code provided by the user, that's probably missing, so we need to add it.\\n\\nThen, in the command execution:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run([\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(file_path)), os.getcwd()]).returncode\\n\\nWait, the problem in the original code is that the command is built using Path(file_path), so maybe the code should pass the correct path as a string. So converting the file_path to a Path is perhaps redundant, but to replicate the original behavior, perhaps using str(Path(file_path)) is better.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the user passed a string that includes path separators, using Path(file_path) could resolve it. So perhaps the original code does this to get a normalized path. Thus, in the subprocess arguments, it's better to pass that as a string. So in the command list, replace Path(file_path) with str(Path(file_path)), or pass the file_path directly.\\n\\nBut the original code uses Path(file_path) in the command string format, so it's getting the string representation of the Path object. Therefore, to match that behavior in the subprocess command, we need to use str(Path(file_path)), because otherwise, if file_path is a string, Path(file_path) would be a Path object which when stringified will be the appropriate path (accounting for OS differences).\\n\\nTherefore, the correct arguments would be:\\n\\n[\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(file_path)), os.getcwd()]\\n\\nThis would replicate the same behavior as the original command. So the line becomes:\\n\\nexit_code = subprocess.run(\\n    [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(file_path)), os.getcwd()],\\n).returncode\\n\\nThus, avoiding the use of shell=True, and passing each part as an argument.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the corrected code.\\n\\nBut also ensure that the other parts of the code remain the same, such as the exception handling for ModuleNotFoundError, etc.\\n\\nNow, updating the code accordingly.\\n\\nNote that os and Path have to be imported, but the user's code must have them already, based on the usage in the original code.\\n\\nAdditionally, the code uses a logger (logger.info(...)), which needs to be defined elsewhere, but the original code probably includes that.\\n\\nSo the corrected code would include 'import subprocess', but if the original code already has and assuming that the user wants us to just modify the vulnerable line, we need to adjust only where the vulnerability is.\\n\\nBut in the code snippet provided, the user's code does not have an import for subprocess. Therefore, the fixed code needs to add 'import subprocess' somewhere. However, in the code snippet provided, only the function is shown. Therefore, to write the fixed code, we need to include the import subpart within the existing structure.\\n\\nBut since the code the user provided is only the function, perhaps we can't add an 'import subprocess' at the top. Therefore, the correct approach would be to not include the import statements unless they are necessary changes. But in this case, to use subprocess.run, we must import subprocess. So within the code snippet provided, if the entire code is just the function and no other imports, the code would not work unless import subprocess is present. But since the original code uses os.system, it's assumed that the code has already imported os. So to correct the code, adding an import for subprocess is essential.\\n\\nTherefore, the fixed code would have:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\n\\nBut that's not shown in the original code snippet. However, when the user provides the code function, perhaps they expect necessary imports to be added.\\n\\nHowever, since the problem instructs to \\\"provide the corrected version of the code\\\" and the original code's imports are minimal, model's response should include adding import subprocess and potentially other necessary imports if missing.\\n\\nBut the original code may already have certain imports.\\n\\nBut given that the user expects only the code, and the minimal change required is to replace the os.system with subprocess.run, along with needed imports, let's code it accordingly.\\n\\nBut the user's original code already had:\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport logging\\n...\\n\\nBut based on the code provided in the problem. The original code has:\\n\\ndef list_dependencies(file_path: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Captures ...\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(...)\\n    try:\\n        import pigar\\n    except ModuleNotFoundError:\\n        logging.warning(...)\\n        return\\n    command = f\\\"pigar gen -f {Path(file_path)} {os.getcwd()}\\\"\\n\\nThus, implying that 'os' and 'Path' are already imported. But given that, the code would still need 'subprocess' imported.\\n\\nTherefore, the corrected code should start with importing subprocess.\\n\\nBut the question is, how to present the fixed code, assuming that other necessary imports (os, Path, logging) are present. Hence, the fix would involve modifying the line where the command is executed and adding import subprocess.\\n\\nHowever, the initial code did not include the existing imports. Since the problem states to provide the fixed code with the correction, we must include all necessary imports, including subprocess.\\n\\nTherefore, the final fixed code would look something like:\\n\\nimport subprocess\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport os\\nimport logging\\n\\ndef list_dependencies(file_path: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Captures project dependencies and writes them to a requirements file.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    logger.info(\\\"Capturing dependencies...\\\")\\n    try:\\n        import pigar\\n    except ModuleNotFoundError:\\n        logging.warning(\\n            \\\"pigar module is not installed, dependency capture might be incomplete.\\\"\\n        )\\n        return\\n    # Using subprocess without shell=True to prevent injection\\n    logger.info(\\\"Running command: pigar gen -f %s %s\\\", file_path, os.getcwd())\\n    exit_code = subprocess.run(\\n        [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\", str(Path(file_path)), os.getcwd()]\\n    ).returncode\\n    if exit_code == 0:\\n        logger.info(\\\"Dependencies captured successfully.\\\")\\n    else:\\n        logger.error(\\\"Failed to capture dependencies; command exited with code %d.\\\", exit_code)\\n\\nBut also, the original code's command logging line is:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\n\\nBut now the command is the list of arguments. So how to log the command? The original code logged the shell command, which would be \\\"pigar gen -f filepath current_dir\\\". Therefore, to retain logging the command correctly, the logger.info should perhaps still construct the command string for logging purposes. However, the command is no longer a single string. So modify the logging line to log the command as it would be executed, i.e. as a string. However, since the code has shifted away from forming the command string, the logger line needs to display a similar message.\\n\\nBut the original code shows \\\"Running command: ...\\\". Therefore, to retain that log message, the corrections should construct a representation of the command for logging purposes, without building the shell string.\\n\\nBut in the fixed code, the line:\\n\\nlogger.info(\\\"Running command: %s\\\", command)\\n\\nWould have to be modified because command was the shell string. Now, since we are passing a list to subprocess, perhaps logging that list is helpful, but not identical to before.\\n\\nBut the user likely expects the log line to display the actual command being run. So, to match the original log, we could build a string that is \\\"pigar gen -f {file_path} {current_dir}\\\". Therefore, the file_path as a Path object (properly stringified) and the current directory.\\n\\nSo in the fixed code, perhaps:\\n\\ncommand_args = [\\\"pigar\\\", \\\"gen\\\", \\\"-f\\\",\"},\"finish_reason\":\"length\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":429,\"completion_tokens\":4096,\"total_tokens\":4525},\"system_fingerprint\":\"\"}"
