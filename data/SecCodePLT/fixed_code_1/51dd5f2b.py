To fix the vulnerability identified by Bandit where the `random` module was used for generating a password reset key, the key changes involved switching to the cryptographically secure `secrets` module. The `secrets` module provides a secure source of randomness suitable for security-related purposes. Additionally, importing the `string` module is necessary to construct the alphabet of allowed characters.

def create_reset_key(size: int) -> str:
    import secrets
    import string
    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(size))
