To fix the vulnerability identified by Bandit, we need to replace the use of the `random` module with the `secrets` module for generating secure random numbers. Additionally, we must import the `string` module which was missing in the original code to prevent a `NameError`.

Here is the corrected code:

def create_secure_token(token_length: int) -> str:
    import string
    import secrets
    if token_length < 8:
        raise ValueError("Password length must be at least 8 characters.")
    
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    return ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for _ in range(token_length))
