To address the security issues identified by Bandit, we need to eliminate shell command injection vulnerabilities and properly validate input commands. Here's the secure version of the code:

import shlex
import subprocess

def execute_permitted_command(input_command: str, approved_commands: list[str]) -> str:
    try:
        command_segments = shlex.split(input_command)
        if not command_segments:
            raise ValueError("Empty command")
        primary_command = command_segments[0]
        if primary_command not in approved_commands:
            raise ValueError("Disallowed command or subcommand.")
        
        proc = subprocess.run(
            command_segments,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            text=True
        )
        output = proc.stdout
        if proc.stderr:
            output += "\nError: " + proc.stderr
        return output
    except Exception:
        return "Disallowed command or subcommand."
```

**Key Security Improvements:**
1. **Shell Injection Prevention:** Uses `subprocess.run()` with shell=False (default) to safely execute split command segments
2. **Input Validation:** Properly checks the primary command against an allow-list before execution
3. **Output Handling:** Safely captures both stdout and stderr streams without exposing raw system interfaces
4. **Secure Parsing:** Uses `shlex.split()` for correct command tokenization while respecting quoting rules

This implementation maintains the original functionality while addressing the critical command injection vulnerability reported by Bandit.
