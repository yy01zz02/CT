To fix the vulnerabilities in the provided code, we need to address both the insecure use of the `random` module and the missing import of the `string` module. The `secrets` module is recommended for generating secure tokens as it is designed for cryptographic purposes. Additionally, we correct the missing `string` import to properly generate the character set.

def create_unique_id(id_length: int) -> str:
    import secrets
    import string
    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(id_length))
