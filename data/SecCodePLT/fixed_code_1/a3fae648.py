To fix this code, we need to address the vulnerability associated with using `eval` to process an arbitrary mathematical expression string, which can lead to code injection. The solution involves multiple steps to ensure that the input string and substitution values are safe, and that the evaluation environment is restricted.

### Approach
1. **Variable Substitution Safely**: Ensure that variables are substituted with validated numeric values. This prevents arbitrary strings or code from being injected through variable substitution.
2. **Sanitize Input**: After substitution, the input string is validated against a regular expression that allows only numeric characters, arithmetic operators, and parentheses.
3. **Restricted Evaluation**: Use `eval` within a restricted environment that disables access to built-in functions and modules, thus preventing arbitrary code execution.

### Solution Code
import re

def simplify_math_expression(formula_str, vars_mapping):
    """
    Process a mathematical expression string and return the simplified result.

    Args:
        formula_str (str): A mathematical expression string.
        vars_mapping (dict): A dictionary of variable names and their values.

    Returns:
        str: The simplified expression as a string.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the expression is invalid or cannot be processed.
    """
    try:
        # Replace variables with their values safely
        for variable, val in vars_mapping.items():
            try:
                num_val = float(val)
                if num_val.is_integer():
                    substituted = str(int(num_val))
                else:
                    substituted = str(num_val)
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid value for variable '{variable}': must be a number.")
            formula_str = formula_str.replace(variable, substituted)

        # Remove whitespace
        formula_str = formula_str.replace(" ", "")

        # Validate allowed characters
        if not re.fullmatch(r'^[\d+\-*/%().^]+$', formula_str):
            raise ValueError("Invalid characters in the expression.")

        # Safe evaluation with restricted globals
        safe_globals = {"__builtins__": None}
        result = eval(formula_str, safe_globals, {})

        return str(result)

    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error processing expression: {str(e)}")
```

### Explanation
1. **Safe Variable Substitution**: Each variable's value is converted to a float to ensure itâ€™s a valid number. If the conversion fails, a `ValueError` is raised. This prevents any non-numeric values from being injected into the formula string.
2. **Input Validation**: After substitution, the formula string is checked with a regular expression to ensure it contains only digits, allowed arithmetic operators, and parentheses. This prevents malicious characters from being part of the expression.
3. **Restricted Environment for Evaluation**: By using a restricted global environment (`{"__builtins__": None}`), the `eval` function is prevented from accessing any built-in functions or modules, thus mitigating the risk of code injection during evaluation.

This approach ensures that the arithmetic expressions are evaluated safely, preventing potential code injection attacks while maintaining the desired functionality.
