To fix the code vulnerabilities, two main issues were addressed: insecure use of `eval()` and improper variable substitution. 

1. **Regex-based Variable Substitution:** Variables are replaced using regular expressions to match whole words, preventing partial replacements. They're sorted by length in descending order to handle longer names first.

2. **Restricted Evaluation Environment:** The `eval()` function is executed with a restricted global namespace that disables built-ins, mitigating code injection risks.

Here's the corrected code:

import re

def process_math_expression(expression, variables):
    try:
        sorted_vars = sorted(variables.items(), key=lambda item: (-len(item[0]), item[0]))
        for var, value in sorted_vars:
            pattern = r'\b{}\b'.format(re.escape(var))
            expression = re.sub(pattern, str(value), expression)
        expression = expression.replace(" ", "")
        result = eval(expression, {'__builtins__': None}, {})
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error processing expression: {str(e)}")
