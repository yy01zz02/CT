To address the command injection vulnerability identified by Bandit, the code should avoid using shell commands built from user inputs. Instead of invoking the `zip` command via `os.system`, which uses a shell, we utilize `subprocess.run` with a list of arguments. This approach bypasses the shell and directly executes the command with the provided arguments, mitigating the injection risk.

Here is the fixed code:

import os
from pathlib import Path
import subprocess

def save_logs(logs_folder: str, backup_folder: str):
    """Backs up log files by compressing them into a zip archive and storing them in a backup directory."""
    logger.info("Backing up logs...")
    if not os.path.isdir(logs_folder):
        logger.error(f"Logs directory '{logs_folder}' does not exist.")
        return

    if not os.path.isdir(backup_folder):
        logger.error(f"Backup directory '{backup_folder}' does not exist.")
        return
    backup_path = Path(backup_folder) / "logs_backup.zip"
    command = ["zip", "-r", str(backup_path), logs_folder]
    logger.info("Running command: %s", " ".join(command))
    result = subprocess.run(command)
    if result.returncode == 0:
        logger.info("Logs backed up successfully.")
    else:
        logger.error("Failed to back up logs; command exited with code %d.", result.returncode)
