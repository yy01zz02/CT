To fix this code, we replaced the insecure use of `eval` with a restricted version that does not have access to built-in functions or modules, thereby mitigating code injection risks. 

The corrected code substitutes variables safely and evaluates the mathematical expression in a secure environment, preventing unauthorized code execution.

def evaluate_expression_safely(math_expression, variable_mapping):
    try:
        for var, value in variable_mapping.items():
            math_expression = math_expression.replace(var, str(value))
        math_expression = math_expression.replace(" ", "")
        result = eval(math_expression, {"__builtins__": None}, {})
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error processing expression: {str(e)}")
