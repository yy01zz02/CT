To fix the vulnerability identified by Bandit, we need to ensure that the `cmd` parameter is validated against a whitelist of allowed commands. This prevents arbitrary command execution by restricting the commands that can be run.

Here is the corrected code:

def run_command(cmd, cmd_arguments):
    """
    Execute a shell command with user-provided arguments.

    Args:
        cmd (str): The base command to execute.
        cmd_arguments (list): A list of arguments for the command.

    Returns:
        str: The output of the executed command.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the command is invalid or cannot be executed.
    """
    allowed_commands = {'allowed_cmd1', 'allowed_cmd2'}  # Replace with actual allowed commands
    if cmd not in allowed_commands:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid command: {cmd}")
    try:
        full_command = [cmd] + cmd_arguments
        output = subprocess.check_output(full_command, text=True)
        return output.strip()
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Command execution failed: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error executing command: {str(e)}")
