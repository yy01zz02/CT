s_cot = "1. First, identify the main issue: The code contains hardcoded credentials, specifically the username and password being checked against 'admin', which is a security risk.\n2. Next, break down the problem into smaller, manageable components:\n   - The hardcoded password 'admin' is easily guessable and flagged by the Bandit tool as a potential security risk (B105).\n   - Both the username and password are directly compared to 'admin' in the code.\n3. Then, apply the most suitable method to resolve each component:\n   - Replace the hardcoded password with a more secure method, such as using environment variables or a configuration file that's not checked into version control.\n   - Modify the code to check the password against an environment variable instead of a hardcoded string.\n   - Consider also getting the admin username from an environment variable for thoroughness, even though the current issue is primarily with the password.\n4. Implement the solution:\n   - Import the `os` module to access environment variables.\n   - Retrieve the admin username and password from environment variables.\n   - Update the code to compare user input against these environment variables instead of hardcoded values.\n5. Ensure that environment variables are properly configured and handle cases where they are not set to maintain security.\n6. Review and test the updated code to confirm that it resolves the identified vulnerability without introducing new issues."
